# Style Scalpel

**Live system:** https://stylescalpel.com

Style Scalpel is a forensic stylometric AI-text analysis system for exploratory comparison of human-written and AI-generated texts. It provides document-level verdicts, paragraph-level probability tables, suspicious-paragraph reporting, and exportable forensic-style HTML evidence.

## Use the live system

Open the hosted version here:

https://stylescalpel.com

## Desktop version

The Windows desktop build is still available as v1.3:

https://github.com/m0333ism-dev/Style-Scalpel/releases/tag/v1.3
## Download

The latest Windows executable is available from the Releases page:

**Latest version:** v1.3
<img width="768" height="568" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9447f51e-ff85-4492-a2be-58e7f5c6ecbc" />

[Download Style Scalpel v1.3](https://github.com/m0333ism-dev/Style-Scalpel/releases/tag/v1.3)

## Important note

Older versions v1.1 and v1.2 are deprecated. Use v1.3 only.

## What it does

- Analyses pasted text or uploaded documents
- Uses interpretable stylometric features
- Produces AI/Human likelihood output
- Designed for academic and forensic-style text analysis

## System requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- No Python installation required for the `.exe` version

## Academic note

This tool is connected to my research on forensic stylometric detection of AI-generated text. The OSF archive is used for research storage and version documentation.

## Benchmark comparison: IDMGSP scientific-paper benchmark

Style Scalpel was evaluated against the IDMGSP benchmark for distinguishing human-written and machine-generated scientific papers. The table below reports accuracy (%) using the same reporting style as the IDMGSP benchmark paper. These results should be interpreted as benchmark evidence for formal scientific-paper text, not as universal proof of AI authorship detection.

**Interpretation.** The stylometric model is highly competitive on the main IDMGSP TEST split, reaching 98.68% under TRAIN, 98.79% under TRAIN + GPT-3, and 98.23% under TRAIN-CG. Its performance is also strong on OOD-REAL and TECG. However, the model performs less consistently on OOD-GPT3 without GPT-3 examples in training and remains weak on TEST-CC, which appears to contain substantial encoding or extraction artifacts. This limitation is reported openly because the tool is intended as a transparent analytical aid, not as automatic proof of AI use.
