# Novel Engine

[Youtube Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRG4_2phOgU)

**A Desktop Publishing Studio for Novels**

**Ten books on Amazon. Built with seven AI editors in one app.**

Novel Engine is a desktop app that pairs you with a full editorial team — a story coach, ghostwriter, first reader, developmental editor, task master, copy editor, and publisher — all running locally on your machine.

*Your manuscript stays on your laptop. Your copyright stays yours.*

I asked Claude and ChatGPT to audit ten books made in the MVP and this product with extended thinking on - [here are the results](https://john-paul-ruf.github.io/novel-engine/evaluation.html)

![Your manuscript, front and center](screenshots/Screenshot%202026-07-08%20at%203.21.28%E2%80%AFAM.png)
*The Manuscript view — your chapters on the left, your prose on the page. Read it like a book, or open the editor and write in it yourself.*

- **Pitch to Published** — A 15-step pipeline takes your idea from a rough pitch to an export-ready manuscript (DOCX/EPUB) you can upload to KDP or send to an editor — then research agents and publishers, generate personalized query letters, and track submissions.
- **Your Voice, Protected** — An interview with Verity, the ghostwriter, captures your prose style in a Voice Profile. Every draft sounds like you — and you can edit any chapter by hand, with your changes tracked and respected.
- **Privacy-First** — Runs on the AI you choose: your Claude account, or free local models via Ollama. There is no Novel Engine cloud. Your drafts never leave your machine except to the AI service *you* connect.

## Your Words Are Yours

> **📄 Your content is yours.** Novel Engine is AGPL-licensed **open-source software**, but the license applies to the *application code only*. Manuscripts, pitches, outlines, story bibles, and exported books you create with it are **your exclusive property** and are **not** covered by the AGPL. Nothing about using Novel Engine open-sources, licenses, or encumbers your writing in any way. Publish on Amazon, sell the film rights, keep it in a drawer — it's yours.

---

## Getting Started (from an installer)

### 1. Download and install

Grab the installer for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/john-paul-ruf/novel-engine/releases/latest).

**macOS (.dmg)** — ⚠️ *The macOS app is currently **not signed or notarized by Apple*** (no Apple Developer account yet). The first time you open it, macOS will warn you and refuse to open it the normal way. This is expected. To open it:

1. Drag **Novel Engine** to Applications
2. **Right-click** (or Control-click) the app → **Open** → **Open**
3. If macOS still blocks it: open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **"Open Anyway"** next to the Novel Engine message

You only have to do this once.

**Windows (installer .exe)** — Windows SmartScreen may show *"Windows protected your PC."* Click **More info → Run anyway**. (Same reason: the installer isn't code-signed yet.)

**Linux (.deb)** — install with your package manager, e.g. `sudo dpkg -i Novel-Engine-*.deb`

### 2. Connect an AI

Novel Engine doesn't ship with an AI inside — it drives one you connect. You need **one** of these:

| Option | Cost | Setup |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Claude** *(recommended — best prose)* | Claude subscription | Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (big green button), then open Terminal and run:<br>`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` and `claude login` |
| **Ollama** *(free, 100% local & private)* | Free | Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) (normal app installer), then in Terminal: `ollama pull` a model of your choice |
| **Codex CLI** | OpenAI account | If it's installed, Novel Engine finds it automatically |

That Terminal step is the most technical thing you'll ever have to do — the app handles everything else. (More backends — llama-server and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — are covered in the [technical guide](./TECHNICAL.md).)

### 3. First launch

The **Onboarding Wizard** takes it from there:

1. **Welcome** — what you're looking at
2. **Provider Setup** — the app checks for Claude / Codex / Ollama and tells you what it found
3. **Model Selection** — pick the AI model to write with (you can change it anytime in Settings)
4. **Author Profile** — a short "who you are as a writer" note the agents read (or skip it)
5. **Ready** — name your first book and go

A guided tour starts automatically, and a floating **Help** assistant (bottom of the icon rail) can answer "how do I…" questions at any time.

---

## Getting Started (from source)

If you'd rather run it from code — this is the whole thing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/john-paul-ruf/novel-engine.git
cd novel-engine
npm install
npm run download-pandoc   # optional — enables DOCX/EPUB export
npm start
```

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+ installed first. Full build and packaging instructions are in the [technical guide](./TECHNICAL.md).

## Meet Your Editorial Team

| Agent | Role | What they do for you |
|-------|------|----------------------|
| **Spark** | Story Coach | Talks through your idea, then writes the pitch — premise, themes, characters, hook |
| **Verity** | Ghostwriter | The only agent that writes prose. Learns your voice from an interview, drafts every chapter in it, and implements revisions |
| **Ghostlight** | First Reader | Reads your manuscript cold — no notes, no context — and tells you what a real reader would feel |
| **Lumen** | Developmental Editor | Deep structural assessment: character arcs, pacing, scene necessity, theme, narrative logic |
| **Forge** | Task Master | Turns all the feedback into a prioritized, step-by-step revision plan |
| **Sable** | Copy Editor | Grammar, consistency, and mechanical polish, with an audit report and style sheet |
| **Quill** | Publisher | Final audit plus publication metadata — title, description, keywords, categories, back-cover copy. Also researches agents and publishers, generates personalized query letters, and tracks your submission targets |

Every agent's instructions are a plain text file on your computer that you can read and edit — no black boxes.

## From Pitch to Published: the Pipeline

Your book moves through **15 phases**, each with a clear deliverable. Nothing advances until *you* confirm it — the app never runs ahead of you.

| Stage | Phases | What you end up with |
|-------|--------|----------------------|
| **Conceive** | Story Pitch → Story Scaffold | A pitch document, scene outline, and story bible |
| **Draft** | First Draft | Every chapter drafted in your voice (one click can auto-draft the whole book, chapter by chapter, with quality checks) |
| **Assess** | First Read → Structural Assessment | A reader report and a developmental edit |
| **Revise** | Revision Plan → Revision → Second Read → Second Assessment | A prioritized task list, the revision executed session by session with your approval, then fresh reads to confirm it worked |
| **Polish** | Copy Edit → Fix Planning → Mechanical Fixes | A line-level audit and the fixes applied |
| **Ship** | Build → Publish & Audit → Query Agents | Your manuscript compiled to Markdown, DOCX, and EPUB, plus publication metadata — then Quill researches agents and publishers, generates query letters, and tracks submissions |

## What Else Is In The Box

- **Query Manager** — after your book is published, Quill can research agents and publishers using web search, auto-populate submission targets, generate personalized query letters, and track your submission status — all in a dedicated view with filters and per-field AI fill
- **Web search for all providers** — every AI backend (Claude, Ollama, llama-server, Codex) can search the web for research, so Quill's query-target research works regardless of which provider you use
- **Pitch Room** — brainstorm freely with Spark; keep, shelve, or discard ideas before they become books
- **Write in it yourself** — the chapter editor is yours too; your edits get an EDITED badge, you can see a diff of exactly what you changed, and Verity is shown your edits so revisions respect them
- **Import your manuscript** — bring an existing book (Word or Markdown) in; chapters are detected automatically, and the AI can backfill the outline, bible, and voice profile from your text
- **Version history everywhere** — every change to every file is snapshotted; view any two versions side by side and restore with one click
- **Hot Take** — a one-click gut-reaction read of your whole manuscript
- **Motif Ledger** — tracks recurring imagery, foreshadowing, and overused phrases across the book
- **Series support** — group books into a series with a shared series bible for cross-volume continuity
- **Statistics** — word-count growth, usage, and cost estimates in friendly charts
- **Command palette** — press **⌘K** (Ctrl+K) and jump to any chapter, phase, or action
- **Works offline-ish** — with Ollama, the entire pipeline runs on your machine with no internet at all

*(The full feature reference, with all the machinery underneath, lives in the [technical guide](./TECHNICAL.md).)*

## Common Questions

**Do I need to pay for AI?**
If you use Claude (recommended for prose quality), you need a Claude subscription — Novel Engine drives the same Claude Code CLI your subscription already covers. If you use Ollama, it's completely free and runs on your own hardware.

**Where is my book stored?**
As plain Markdown files in a folder on your computer (shown in Settings). No proprietary format, no lock-in — you can open your chapters in any text editor, forever.

**Is my writing private?**
Novel Engine has no cloud, no accounts, and no telemetry. Your text is sent only to the AI backend you connected — and if that's Ollama, it never leaves your machine at all.

**Will using this affect my copyright?**
No. See [Your Words Are Yours](#your-words-are-yours) above — the open-source license covers the app's code, not your writing.

**Something broke / I'm confused.**
Click the **Help** bubble in the app, open an [issue](https://github.com/john-paul-ruf/novel-engine/issues), or email [john.paul.ruf@gmail.com](mailto:john.paul.ruf@gmail.com?subject=Novel%20Engine).

> ### 🧪 Testers Needed!
>
> The installers are early builds and **have not been tested on all platforms** — I develop on macOS, so the Windows and Linux installers especially need eyes on them. If you try one, **please report what happens** — perfect, crash, or anything in between: [issues](https://github.com/john-paul-ruf/novel-engine/issues) or [john.paul.ruf@gmail.com](mailto:john.paul.ruf@gmail.com?subject=Novel%20Engine%20Installer%20Testing).

## For Developers

All the engineering detail lives out of the way:

- **[TECHNICAL.md](./TECHNICAL.md)** — architecture, tech stack, project structure, AI backend internals, database schema, building installers
- **[docs/architecture/](./docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)** — layer-by-layer architecture documentation
- **[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)** and **[RELEASE_NOTES.md](./RELEASE_NOTES.md)** — what's changed

Novel Engine is built with Electron, React, and TypeScript in a clean five-layer architecture, and it's open source under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE) — contributions and bug reports welcome.

---

## License

The application code is licensed under [AGPL-3.0-only](LICENSE).

> **Reminder:** the license covers the app's source code. **Everything you write with the app is yours alone** — manuscripts, outlines, exports, all of it. See [Your Words Are Yours](#your-words-are-yours).

# Dedication
*To everyone who has an idea for a good book but doesn't know how to craft it, this is for you...*

*For everyone else who may be impacted by this work, or whose sensibilities I have offended.*
*I am so sorry.  I just wanted to write my memoir and found out it is easier to write fiction than fact. This is the result.*
