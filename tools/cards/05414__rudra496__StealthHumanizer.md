---

> **Try it now: [stealthhumanizer.vercel.app](https://stealthhumanizer.vercel.app/) -- paste AI text, click humanize. Done. Zero config: the public deployment ships with **Rudra's Free Usage Model** as the default.**

---

## Rudra's Free Usage Model

Starting with v2.4, the hosted app ships with a free, pre-configured model — **no API key needed from you.** Just paste text and click Humanize. **Auto-routing by input length** picks the best backend:

- **Short text (≤150 words)** → `cive202/humanize-ai-text-bart-large` (BART, 406M, sub-1B). Purpose-built humanizer backed by a peer-reviewed paper (Paneru 2026, BERTScore 0.924). Latency ~5–12s. Preserves length and facts on paragraphs, abstracts, social posts.
- **Long text (>150 words)** → `gemma3:4b` via Ollama (4B params). The only faithful option for full essays, LORs, dissertations. Latency ~25–90s on free ARM CPU. (No sub-1B model can faithfully rewrite long form — every alternative tested either summarized, hallucinated fake facts, or degraded into repetition.)
- **AI Detector**: `fakespot-ai/roberta-base-ai-text-detection-v1` (RoBERTa-base, 125M params) — runs automatically after every humanize and shows the verdict inline below the result.
- **Hosting**: maintainer's free Oracle Cloud ARM (Ampere A1) VPS. ~70ms detect.
- **Privacy**: your text goes straight from the Vercel frontend to the Oracle VPS over HTTPS. The API keys live in Vercel env vars and never reach the browser.

Want to use it on your own deployment? Set these three env vars (see `.env.example`):

```
RUDRA_API_BASE_URL=https://129-159-229-170.sslip.io
RUDRA_HUMANIZER_API_KEY=...
RUDRA_DETECTOR_API_KEY=...
```

Prefer a different default? Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=gemini` (or any other provider id).

> **Backend swap note (v2.4.0 → v2.4.1 → v2.4.2):**
> - v2.4.0 used `amicus-humanizer-v1-onnx` (T5, 60M) — produced lossy 19-word summaries. Swapped out.
> - v2.4.1 used `gemma3:4b` for everything — slow on short text.
> - v2.4.2 auto-routes: `cive202/humanize-ai-text-bart-large` (406M sub-1B specialized humanizer) for ≤150 words, `gemma3:4b` for long text. The only honest mapping of "fast sub-1B where safe, faithful larger model where required."

---

## What's new in 2.3

A focused quality + reliability pass. The headline change: **the output no longer breaks.**

- **Natural, complete sentences.** Rewrote the re-humanize prompt and removed the post-processing steps that injected orphan fragments ("Honestly?", "But get this—?"), mangled em-dashes into broken punctuation ("word—?" → "word,?"), and force-lowercased proper nouns. Every sentence is now grammatical and complete, with a final capitalization safety net.
- **Real human tone, less AI footprint.** Collocations now respect word boundaries (no more "make easierd"), context-blind swaps like `thing→stuff` are gone, and empty AI-phrase replacements no longer leave dangling commas.
- **GPTZero API scoring removed from the UI.** Without an API key it only showed a confusing local fallback — so detection stays local (Human Score, heatmap, readability) and external checks are one-click links to GPTZero, ZeroGPT, and Copyleaks.
- **Simpler, calmer UI.** Advanced options collapsed by default, the redundant stats grid replaced with a slim footer, cleaner action labels, and no more silent clipboard writes or runaway auto-refine loops. Refinement is now opt-in (button) and bounded.
- **`npm run lint` and the CLI runner work again** (Next 16 dropped `next lint`; flat ESLint 9 config added; Windows `.mjs` CLI spawn fixed).

See the [full changelog](./CHANGELOG.md#230---2026-06-28) for details.

## Why StealthHumanizer?

AI detectors (GPTZero, Originality.ai, Turnitin) catch AI text through statistical fingerprints:
- **Low perplexity** — predictable, boring word choices
- **Low burstiness** — uniform sentence lengths
- **AI-typical phrases** — "furthermore," "it is important to note," "delve into"
- **Rigid structure** — same paragraph pattern throughout

**StealthHumanizer disrupts all of these signals** with a 4-layer pipeline that produces text reading like a real person wrote it.

## How It Works

### 4-Layer Humanization Pipeline

```
Input Text → Layer 1: LLM Rewrite → Layer 2: Post-Processing → Layer 3: Multi-Model Chain → Layer 4: Final Polish → Output
```

**Layer 1 — LLM Rewrite**: Your chosen AI provider rewrites the text using anti-detection prompts that enforce burstiness, perplexity injection, and structural disruption.

**Layer 2 — Non-LLM Post-Processing**: 500+ synonym swaps, 230+ collocation replacements, AI vocabulary removal, sentence length manipulation, typographic variation. Style-aware — academic text stays formal, casual text gets personality.

**Layer 3 — Multi-Model Chain (Optional)**: Pass text through multiple AI providers to mix statistical fingerprints. Each model adds different patterns.

**Layer 4 — Final Polish**: Light cleanup pass. Readability guard ensures quality doesn't degrade.

### Detection Metrics

The built-in detector analyzes:
- Perplexity (word choice unpredictability)
- Burstiness (sentence length variation)
- Vocabulary diversity
- AI phrase density
- Passive voice ratio
- Transition word frequency
- Sentence start diversity
- Hedging language
- Quantifier overuse
- Pronoun usage patterns

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudra496/StealthHumanizer.git
cd StealthHumanizer
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and add your API key in Settings. **Gemini is free** — get a key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

Or use it live at [stealthhumanizer.vercel.app](https://stealthhumanizer.vercel.app/).

## CLI

StealthHumanizer now ships an initial command-line interface for local
humanization and detector checks.

```bash
# Run without installing a global binary
npm run cli -- detect --text "Furthermore, it is important to note that..."

# Humanize from stdin with the Gemini provider
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"
echo "Draft text..." | npm run cli -- humanize --model gemini --level medium

# Read and write files
npm run cli -- humanize --input draft.txt --output humanized.txt --style academic
```

The package exposes both `stealthhumanizer` and `stealth-humanize` binaries
when built or linked:

```bash
npm run cli:build
npm link
stealthhumanizer providers
```

Useful commands:

- `humanize` - runs the full multi-pass rewriting pipeline
- `detect` - scores text with the built-in AI-signal detector, no API key needed
- `providers` - lists provider ids, default models, and API key environment variables

Run `npm run cli -- --help` for the full option list.

### Local CLI-runner providers (no API key)

Two providers run a local CLI you already have logged in, as a subprocess,
instead of calling an HTTP API. They use the binary's own auth, so no API key
is required:

```bash
# Uses your local Claude Code login
stealthhumanizer humanize --model claude-code -i draft.txt

# Uses your local OpenAI Codex login
echo "Draft text..." | stealthhumanizer humanize --model codex
```

- `--model claude-code` spawns your local `claude` CLI (Claude Code)
- `--model codex` spawns your local `codex` CLI (OpenAI Codex)
- Point at a non-default binary with `STEALTHHUMANIZER_CLAUDE_CODE_BIN` or
  `STEALTHHUMANIZER_CODEX_BIN`
- CLI-only: these are skipped by auto-selection and are not available in the
  browser or serverless runtimes (they spawn a subprocess). The web API rejects
  them (including in model chains) so a browser user can't make a self-hosted
  server spawn its logged-in CLI.

**Security note — untrusted input.** The text being humanized is treated as
untrusted (it can contain prompt-injection). The runners are confined so an
injected instruction can't make the agent act:

- `claude-code` runs with `--tools ""`, which fully disables all tools — it
  cannot read/write files or run commands. Preferred for untrusted input.
- `codex` has no "disable all tools" switch, so it is confined as tightly as
  the platform allows: `--sandbox read-only` (no writes/network), an isolated
  empty working directory, and no inherited environment. A determined injection
  could still read absolute paths via a read-only command, so prefer
  `claude-code` when the input is fully untrusted.

Run `npm run test:cli` to build the packaged CLI entry point and execute the
CLI regression suite.

## Implemented roadmap capabilities

- **Real-time streaming endpoint:** `POST /api/humanize/stream` returns Server-Sent Events with `progress`, `result`, `error`, and `done` events so web or API clients can show live pipeline status.
- **Semantic fidelity validation:** every humanization result now includes a BERTScore-inspired semantic report with keyword recall, length alignment, sentence alignment, warnings, and a preserved/review/drift verdict.
- **Client-side Privacy Mode:** the Humanizer UI can run a local deterministic rewrite with no provider API key and no network model call, useful for sensitive drafts or offline local-model workflows.
- **Observability & cost dashboard:** the Dashboard tab tracks run count, estimated cost, latency, human score, semantic score, and recent run history in browser storage.
- **API service layer:** `POST /api/v1/humanize` supports programmatic use with optional `STEALTHHUMANIZER_API_TOKEN` service authentication and provider-key environment fallback.
- **Browser extension starter:** `extension/` contains a Manifest V3 Chrome/Firefox-compatible companion that sends selected page text to a local or hosted StealthHumanizer instance.
- **Detector benchmarking dashboard:** the Dashboard tab includes a built-in benchmark runner that compares detector scores before and after the offline privacy rewrite.
- **Screenshot without Playwright download:** use `npm run screenshot -- http://localhost:3000 /tmp/stealthhumanizer-dashboard.png` after starting the dev server; it uses an installed Chrome/Chromium binary and avoids registry downloads.
