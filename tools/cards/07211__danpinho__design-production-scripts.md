# design-production-scripts

Small scripts that take the repetitive work out of design production — renaming exports, setting up documents, formatting pasted content, and other things that shouldn't require manual effort.

Built for InDesign, Illustrator, and macOS.

## Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `indesign/` | Adobe InDesign scripts (ExtendScript/JSX) |
| `illustrator/` | Adobe Illustrator scripts (ExtendScript/JSX) |
| `macos/` | macOS automation scripts (AppleScript) |
| `general/` | Cross-platform utilities — renaming, data conversion, image metadata |

## Scripts

### InDesign

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`indesign/apply-markdown.jsx`](indesign/apply-markdown.jsx) | Converts pasted Markdown text (e.g. from LLM output) into InDesign paragraph and character styles, including native table conversion with applied paragraph and table styles |
| [`indesign/batch-export-pdf.jsx`](indesign/batch-export-pdf.jsx) | Batch-exports all `.indd` files in a selected folder to PDF using the High Quality Print preset — saves into a `PDF/` subfolder |
| [`indesign/batch-export-interactive.jsx`](indesign/batch-export-interactive.jsx) | Batch-exports all `.indd` files in a selected folder to Interactive PDF — saves into a `PDF_Interactive/` subfolder |
| [`indesign/batch-export-jpeg.jsx`](indesign/batch-export-jpeg.jsx) | Batch-exports all `.indd` files in a selected folder to JPEG (one file per page, high quality) — saves into a `JPEG/` subfolder |
| [`indesign/clean-up-layers.jsx`](indesign/clean-up-layers.jsx) | Sorts all page items into three layers (Text, Images, Vectors) based on content type — useful for organizing old, unstructured documents |
| [`indesign/export-web-print.jsx`](indesign/export-web-print.jsx) | Exports two PDFs at once — web-optimized (`-web.pdf`) for client delivery and high-res (`-print.pdf`) for print and mockups — saves to the project's `PDFs/` subfolder |
| [`indesign/md-to-text-frame.jsx`](indesign/md-to-text-frame.jsx) | Places the contents of a Markdown file into the selected text frame — opens a file picker and inserts the raw text |
| [`indesign/rename-by-week.py`](indesign/rename-by-week.py) | Renames InDesign exports by ISO calendar week (German `KW` format, e.g. `2026-KW03`), sorted by modified date — adds a sequence suffix only when multiple files share a week |
| [`indesign/restructure-xml.py`](indesign/restructure-xml.py) | Restructures an XML file for InDesign import by extracting category values from rows into standalone elements |
| [`indesign/save-version.jsx`](indesign/save-version.jsx) | Freezes the active document as the next numbered version — copies it to `Versionen/<name>-vNN.indd` and exports `PDFs/<name>-vNN.pdf` with a selectable PDF preset |
| [`indesign/setup-layers.jsx`](indesign/setup-layers.jsx) | Sets up a standardized layer structure (Images, Vectors, Text) with assigned colors, renaming default layers if present |
| [`indesign/xml-tags-to-styles.jsx`](indesign/xml-tags-to-styles.jsx) | Creates matching paragraph styles from all XML tags in the document — useful for bootstrapping an XML import workflow |

### Illustrator

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`illustrator/setup-layers-en.jsx`](illustrator/setup-layers-en.jsx) | Builds the nine-layer structure for brand/logo master documents with English layer names (Notes → Background), locks the three non-printing guide layers, and leaves Logo-Color active |
| [`illustrator/setup-layers-de.jsx`](illustrator/setup-layers-de.jsx) | Same layer structure with German layer names (Anmerkungen → Hintergrund), leaving Logo-Farbig active |
| [`illustrator/colorize-layers-en.jsx`](illustrator/colorize-layers-en.jsx) | Duplicates the artwork from Logo-Color onto Logo-Positive (100% black) and Logo-Negative (white), applying the respective CMYK fill to each copy |
| [`illustrator/colorize-layers-de.jsx`](illustrator/colorize-layers-de.jsx) | Same for the German layer set: Logo-Farbig → Logo-Positiv and Logo-Negativ |
| [`illustrator/export-layers.jsx`](illustrator/export-layers.jsx) | Saves each layer as a separate .ai file named after the document and layer |
| [`illustrator/export-layers-svg.jsx`](illustrator/export-layers-svg.jsx) | Exports each layer as a separate SVG file into an SVG subfolder next to the source file |
| [`illustrator/export-print.jsx`](illustrator/export-print.jsx) | Exports EPS, SVG, and PDF into separate subfolders next to the source file |
| [`illustrator/export-web.jsx`](illustrator/export-web.jsx) | Exports SVG and high-res PNG (300 DPI, transparent) into separate subfolders next to the source file |

### macOS

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`macos/create-project-folder.applescript`](macos/create-project-folder.applescript) | Creates an Adobe production project folder with `Links/`, `PDFs/`, `Versionen/`, `Zuarbeit/` subfolders — prompts for a client number and project number and names the folder by numbers only, `CCCC-YYPPP` (e.g. `0001-26001`: 4-digit client, 2-digit year auto-prefixed, 3-digit project; next free number per client + year pre-filled) |
| [`macos/rename-images.scpt`](macos/rename-images.scpt) | Batch-renames image files in a folder using a `{project-id}_{location}_{sequence}.ext` convention — prompts for project ID, location, and start number, then sorts by modification date (oldest first) |

### General

| Script | Description |
|--------|----------related:
  - methods/QUICK_START.md
---|
| [`general/create-folders.py`](general/create-folders.py) | Creates a folder hierarchy from a Markdown list — each `- item` becomes a folder, indentation (2 spaces) defines nesting |
| [`general/rename-by-csv.py`](general/rename-by-csv.py) | Renames files in a folder based on a CSV mapping with `original_file` and `filename` columns — skips missing files and name conflicts |
| [`general/csv-to-xml.py`](general/csv-to-xml.py) | Converts a CSV file to XML — each row becomes a `<Row>` element with child elements per column, UTF-8 encoded |
| [`general/excel-titlecase.py`](general/excel-titlecase.py) | Converts a specified column in an Excel file to title case and saves the result as a new file |
| [`general/image-exif-description.py`](general/image-exif-description.py) | Reads a CSV with `filename` and `description` columns and writes the description into the EXIF metadata of each image |
| [`general/csv-to-chart/`](general/csv-to-chart/) | Renders CSV data (`category`, `value` columns) as SVG bar charts using Observable Plot — single file (`chart.js`) or batch mode for all CSVs in a folder (`batch.js`) |
