![teaser](./assets/teaser.jpg)

> **Abstract:** *Achieving flexible and high-fidelity identity-preserved image generation remains formidable, particularly with advanced Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) like FLUX. We introduce **InfiniteYou (InfU)**, one of the earliest robust frameworks leveraging DiTs for this task. InfU addresses significant issues of existing methods, such as insufficient identity similarity, poor text-image alignment, and low generation quality and aesthetics. Central to InfU is InfuseNet, a component that injects identity features into the DiT base model via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity while maintaining generation capabilities. A multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data, further improves text-image alignment, ameliorates image quality, and alleviates face copy-pasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfU achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines. In addition, the plug-and-play design of InfU ensures compatibility with various existing methods, offering a valuable contribution to the broader community.*

## 💡 Important Usage Tips

- We released two model variants of InfiniteYou-FLUX v1.0: [aes_stage2](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/InfiniteYou/tree/main/infu_flux_v1.0/aes_stage2) and [sim_stage1](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/InfiniteYou/tree/main/infu_flux_v1.0/sim_stage1). The `aes_stage2` is our model after SFT, which is used by default for better text-image alignment and aesthetics. For higher ID similarity, please try `sim_stage1` (using `--model_version` to switch). More details can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16418).

- To better fit specific personal needs, we find that two arguments are highly useful to adjust: <br />`--infusenet_conditioning_scale` (default: `1.0`) and `--infusenet_guidance_start` (default: `0.0`). Usually, you may NOT need to adjust them. If necessary, start by trying a slightly larger `--infusenet_guidance_start` (*e.g.*, `0.1`) only (especially helpful for `sim_stage1`). If still not satisfactory, then try a slightly smaller `--infusenet_conditioning_scale` (*e.g.*, `0.9`).

- We also provided two LoRAs ([Realism](https://civitai.com/models/631986?modelVersionId=706528) and [Anti-blur](https://civitai.com/models/675581/anti-blur-flux-lora)) to enable additional usage flexibility. If needed, try `Realism` only first.  They are *entirely optional*, which are examples to try but are NOT used in our paper.

- If the generated gender does not align with your preferences, try adding specific words in the text prompt, such as 'a man', 'a woman', *etc*. We encourage users to use inclusive and respectful language.

## 🔧 Requirements and Installation

### Dependencies

Simply run this one-line command to install (feel free to create a `python3` virtual environment before you run):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Memory Requirements 

- **Full-performance**: The original `bf16` model inference requires a **peak VRAM** of around **43GB**.

- **Fast CPU offloading**: By specifying only `--cpu_offload` in [test.py](https://github.com/bytedance/InfiniteYou/blob/main/test.py#L44), the **peak VRAM** is reduced to around **30GB** with **NO** performance degradation.

- **8-bit quantization**: By specifying only `--quantize_8bit` in [test.py](https://github.com/bytedance/InfiniteYou/blob/main/test.py#L44), the **peak VRAM** is reduced to around **24GB** with performance remaining very similar.

- **Combining fast CPU offloading and 8-bit quantization**: By specifying both `--cpu_offload` and <br />`--quantize_8bit`, the **peak VRAM** is further reduced to around **16GB** with performance remaining very similar.

If you want to use our models but only have a GPU with even less VRAM, please further refer to [Diffusers memory reduction tips](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/optimization/memory), where some more aggressive strategies may be helpful. Community contributions are also welcome.

## 🆚 Comparison with State-of-the-Art Relevant Methods

![comparative_results](./assets/comparative_results.jpg)

Qualitative comparison results of InfU with the state-of-the-art baselines, FLUX.1-dev IP-Adapter and PuLID-FLUX. The identity similarity and text-image alignment of the results generated by FLUX.1-dev IP-Adapter (IPA) are inadequate. PuLID-FLUX generates images with decent identity similarity. However, it suffers from poor text-image alignment (Columns 1, 2, 4), and the image quality (e.g., bad hands in Column 5) and aesthetic appeal are degraded. In addition, the face copy-paste issue of PuLID-FLUX is evident (Column 5). In comparison, the proposed InfU outperforms the baselines across all dimensions.


## ⚙️ Plug-and-Play Property with Off-the-Shelf Popular Approaches

![plug_and_play](./assets/plug_and_play.jpg)

InfU features a desirable plug-and-play design, compatible with many existing methods. It naturally supports base model replacement with any variants of FLUX.1-dev, such as FLUX.1-schnell for more efficient generation (e.g., in 4 steps). The compatibility with ControlNets and LoRAs provides more controllability and flexibility for customized tasks. Notably, the compatibility with OminiControl extends our potential for multi-concept personalization, such as interacted identity (ID) and object personalized generation. InfU is also compatible with IP-Adapter (IPA) for stylization of personalized images, producing decent results when injecting style references via IPA. Our plug-and-play feature may extend to even more approaches, providing valuable contributions to the broader community.
