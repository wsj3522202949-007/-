# ⚡ FlowForge — Workflow Automation Builder

**FlowForge is a full-stack, no-code workflow automation tool.** Instead of writing
code or wiring up integrations by hand, you visually stack up to **8 configurable
steps** — *"when this happens → filter it → transform it → notify someone"* — then
save it, run it, and watch it execute in real time. It turns a ~3-hour manual setup
into a few minutes of clicking.

Think of it as a focused, self-hostable alternative to Zapier or Make, built on a
modern React + Supabase stack with a clean, animated UI and a real execution engine
that sends actual emails and Slack messages.

## ✨ Features

- **8 step types** — Trigger, Filter, Transform, Notify, Integrate, Delay, Condition, Action
- **Inline configuration** — each step expands with type-specific fields (dropdowns, inputs)
- **Real execution engine** — a Supabase Edge Function runs your steps and sends actual emails / Slack messages
- **Live activity feed** — watch runs stream in real time (Supabase Realtime) with a full step-by-step log
- **Scheduled triggers** — fire a workflow on a CRON schedule via `pg_cron`
- **Per-user accounts** — auth + Row-Level Security, so each user only sees their own workflows
- **Light & dark themes** — toggle with a persisted preference
- **Accessible & responsive** — WCAG 2.0 AA, keyboard navigation, mobile bottom-nav

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript, Vite |
| UI / Motion | Framer Motion, Lucide icons, custom CSS |

## 🚀 How to Use the Product

Once you're signed in, building an automation takes four steps:

### 1. Sign up / Sign in
Open the app and create an account with your email and a password. You land on the
**Home** dashboard.

### 2. Build a workflow
- Go to **Builder** (left sidebar)
- Give your workflow a **name** (required) and an optional description
- Click **+ Add Step** and pick from the 8 step types — add up to 8
- Click any step to **expand and configure** it. A typical notification flow:
  1. **Trigger** — *when* it runs (Webhook, Schedule, Incoming Email, Form…)
  2. **Filter** *(optional)* — only continue if a condition is met (e.g. `rating equals 1`)
  3. **Notify** — the alert itself (Channel: Email/Slack, Recipient, Template)

### 3. Simulate & Save
- Hit **Simulate** to preview the flow — each step lights up and checks off in order
- Hit **Save Workflow** to persist it to your account

### 4. Run it & watch it live
- Go to **Saved** — every workflow shows its steps, status, and an **Activity** panel
- Click **Run** to fire it now. The execution log streams into the live Activity feed:
  each step's result, success/failure, and the notification that was sent
- Toggle a workflow **Active/Paused**, or delete it, anytime

> **Tip:** A minimal "get a notification" workflow is just two steps —
> `Trigger (Webhook) → Notify (Email, your@email.com)`. The Trigger decides *when*;
> the Notify step *sends* the alert.

## Getting Started (local development)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173`. You'll need to configure Supabase (below) before
you can sign in.

## Supabase Setup (backend)

FlowForge uses **Supabase** for the database and authentication. Workflows are
saved per-user with Row-Level Security, so each account only sees its own data.

### 1. Create a project
- Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → **New project**
- Wait for it to finish provisioning

### 2. Create the database table
- In your project, open **SQL Editor → New query**
- Paste the contents of `[`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql)` and click **Run**
- This creates the `workflows` table, an `updated_at` trigger, and RLS policies

### 3. Add your credentials
- In Supabase: **Settings → API**, copy the **Project URL** and **anon public key**
- In the project root, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:
  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env.local      # macOS/Linux
  copy .env.example .env.local    # Windows
  ```
- Fill in your values:
  ```
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-public-key
  ```
- **Restart the dev server** (`npm run dev`) so Vite picks up the env vars

### 4. (Optional) Disable email confirmation for faster testing
- **Authentication → Providers → Email** → turn off *"Confirm email"* if you want
  to sign in immediately after sign-up without checking your inbox

Once configured, the login screen lets you sign up / sign in, and saved
workflows persist to your Supabase database.

## Execution Engine (sending real notifications)

The **Run** button on a saved workflow calls a Supabase **Edge Function**
(`supabase/functions/run-workflow`) that runs each step in order and actually
sends a notification at the Notify step.

### 1. Install the Supabase CLI & link your project
```bash
npm install -g supabase
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref YOUR-PROJECT-REF
```

### 2. Deploy the function (public webhook — no JWT)
```bash
supabase functions deploy run-workflow --no-verify-jwt
```

### 3. Add an email provider secret (for real emails)
Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com) (free tier), grab an API key, then:
```bash
supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_key
# optional: a verified sender, otherwise Resend's sandbox address is used
supabase secrets set FROM_EMAIL="FlowForge <you@yourdomain.com>"
```
For Slack notifications, create an [Incoming Webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and:
```bash
supabase secrets set SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
```

> Without these secrets the engine still runs — it just reports a **DRY RUN**
> for the notify step instead of sending. Great for testing the flow first.

### 4. Try it
- Build a workflow with a **Notify** step (Channel: Email, Recipient: your email)
- Save it, go to **Saved**, click **Run**
- You'll see a step-by-step execution log; with `RESEND_API_KEY` set, the email
  actually lands in your inbox

### Triggering from outside (real webhook)
Any external system can fire a workflow by POSTing to the function:
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/run-workflow \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "workflowId": "<uuid>", "payload": { "review": { "rating": "1" } } }'
```
The `payload` is the trigger data your **Filter** steps evaluate against.

> **Note:** `.env.local` is git-ignored — never commit your keys. The `anon`
> key is safe for the browser; RLS is what protects the data.

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output goes to the `dist/` folder.

## Deploying to AWS Amplify

1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Go to [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify)
3. Click **Host a web app** → connect your GitHub repo
4. Amplify auto-detects Vite — confirm these settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
5. Deploy — you get a public URL on every push to `main`
