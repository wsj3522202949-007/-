## ✨ What is this?

**AI Shortcuts** is a personal fork of **WritingTools** — an Apple Intelligence-inspired, system-wide AI writing assistant for **macOS, Windows & Linux**.

With one hotkey press, it lets you fix grammar, rewrite text, change tone, summarize content (webpages, YouTube transcripts, documents), and more — without ever leaving your current app.

This fork builds on top of the original idea with significant macOS enhancements: more AI providers, image & file attachments, a richer native UI, and quality-of-life improvements throughout.

> **🍎 macOS users:** This fork focuses on the native Swift/SwiftUI macOS version. Windows & Linux are inherited from the original project.

## 🆕 What's New in This Fork (macOS)

On top of everything the original macOS port offers, this fork adds:

### 📎 Attachments in Prompts
- **Paste images directly** from clipboard into custom prompts
- **Attach image files** (PNG, JPG, HEIC, etc.) via file picker or drag-and-drop
- **Attach plain text files** — content is read and sent as context to the AI
- Attachments also supported in **follow-up questions** in the response window
- Unsupported file types show a clear error instead of failing silently

### ✏️ Smarter Input
- **Multi-line expandable input** — grows up to 5 lines, then scrolls
- **Enter** to send, **Shift+Enter** or **Alt+Enter** to insert a new line
- Input and attachments are **reset on each popup open**
- Thin overlay scrollbar for clean aesthetics

### 🧩 Command Management
- **Drag-to-reorder** command buttons directly in the popup (edit mode)
- **Import / export individual commands** as JSON files
- **Export full config** (all commands + custom instruction) as a backup
- **Import full config** to restore or share your setup
- Per-command custom AI provider support

### 🖥️ UI & UX
- Wider popup (380px) for more breathing room
- **Drag popup across multiple screens** — not locked to the originating display
- Horizontal attachment strip with **drag-to-scroll** gesture
- Response window follow-up input also supports attachments and multi-line

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed:** On newer macOS versions, the onboarding flow could not locate the correct path to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, leaving users unable to grant Accessibility or Screen Recording permissions. The deep link now opens the correct pane directly.

---

## 🛠 Common Issues

### Commands not showing after selecting text

When you select text and open the popup, but only see the text input box with no command buttons — this is almost always an **Accessibility permission issue**.

AI Shortcuts needs Accessibility access to read your selected text. Without it, the app cannot detect what you've highlighted and won't display the command list.

**How to fix:**

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**
2. Find **AI Shortcuts** in the list — if the toggle is OFF, turn it ON
3. If AI Shortcuts is not in the list, or the issue persists after enabling:
   - Select **AI Shortcuts** and click the **`−`** button to remove it
   - Relaunch the app — it will prompt you to grant Accessibility permission again
   - Click **Open System Settings**, then enable the toggle

> **Note:** On macOS, the app must be added under its current name. If you previously had an older version listed (e.g. "WritingTools"), remove that entry and add the current version instead.

---

## 🔮 What's Coming

- **Windows & Linux parity** — Gradually bring the macOS-exclusive features (attachments, richer command management, more providers) to the Windows & Linux version
- **Multi-language & custom language support** — Let users set a preferred response language, and support custom language configurations beyond the built-in UI locales
- **Ongoing bug fixes** — Continuously improving stability and compatibility across macOS versions

---

## ✅ Installation

### 🍎 macOS

**Requirements:** macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later.

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/gemkids/WritingTools/releases) page and download the latest macOS `.dmg` file.
2. Open the `.dmg`, drag `writing-tools.app` into your **Applications** folder.
3. Launch the app — it will guide you through permissions and initial setup.

**Permissions required (prompted on first launch):**
- **Accessibility** — to read and replace selected text system-wide
- **Screen Recording** — for apps that restrict text access via Accessibility API

Manage these under **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.

> **Hotkey conflict?** If your shortcut clashes with Spotlight or Input Source switching, set a custom hotkey in Settings and adjust **System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts**.

---

### 🪟 Windows & 🐧 Linux

Refer to the [original WritingTools project](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools) for Windows & Linux installation. The `Windows_and_Linux/` folder in this repo contains an updated version with additional AI providers.

**Quick start:**
```bash
cd Windows_and_Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

---

## 🔒 Privacy

- **No telemetry, no logging, no ads.** The app collects nothing.
- API keys are stored in the **macOS Keychain** (not plain UserDefaults).
- Text is only sent to your chosen AI provider when you explicitly trigger an action.
- Use **local MLX or Ollama** to keep everything fully on-device.
- Refer to your AI provider's privacy policy when using cloud models.

## 👨‍💻 About the Author

**Nam Trần** — a web developer and technology enthusiast based in Vietnam.

I'm primarily a web developer, so macOS and Swift are not my home turf. I built this in my spare time because I wanted a more powerful AI writing assistant that fits the way I work — and decided to share it openly in case it helps others too.

This fork is completely free — no subscription, no maintenance fee, no catch. Every feature here was built on personal time and shared openly in the spirit of the original project.

**Found a bug or have an idea?**  
Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gemkids275/WritingToolsV2/issues). I check issues regularly and will fix anything that's important or genuinely useful. If you have a feature idea, share it — I'll consider building it if it's feasible.

If any of this makes your workflow a little better, leaving a ⭐ on GitHub is the best way to say thanks. It costs nothing and means a lot.

If you have any concerns regarding copyright, intellectual property, or any other serious matter related to this project — please email me at **gemkids275@gmail.com**. I will review the issue promptly and take it down immediately if it affects the original authors or violates any rights.
