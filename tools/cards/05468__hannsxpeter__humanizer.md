# humanizer

A standalone, pure-prompt skill that rewrites AI-sounding prose so it reads as
genuinely human, and rewrites in a specific writer's voice when a sample or
style profile is available. It is just instructions: `SKILL.md` plus a few
reference files. No scripts, no dependencies, no network access.

## Where this comes from

This skill was built from the voice-preservation logic that powers
[Scriveno](https://github.com/aihxp/scriveno) (formerly Scriven), an
AI-native longform writing system whose core promise is narrow and
high-stakes: drafted prose should sound like the writer, not like AI.
Scriveno is a spec-driven creative-writing, publishing, and translation
pipeline for AI coding agents. It profiles a writer's voice, loads that
Voice DNA into every drafting step, keeps each unit on fresh context, and
runs a Polish pass (editor review, line and copy edit, voice check,
originality check) so prose stays specific to the project instead of
collapsing into generic machine output.

`humanizer` lifts the part of that pipeline that finds and removes AI writing
tells while protecting a writer's authentic voice, and packages it as a
standalone, tool-agnostic skill: the same de-slop, restraint, and
voice-matching philosophy Scriveno applies across a full manuscript, usable
on any prose in any supported tool. If you want the whole writing,
publishing, and translation pipeline rather than just this de-slop layer, see
Scriveno: https://github.com/aihxp/scriveno (npm package: `scriveno-cli`).

## Why this one is different

- **Faithfulness over liveliness.** A three-layer guard plus a mandatory
  meaning check stop the most common humanizer failure: inventing plausible
  facts, causes, or quotes to make a rewrite "sound concrete."
- **Restraint by design.** A density pre-check scales effort to evidence, and
  an explicit do-not-flag reference protects already-human writing instead of
  laundering it into smooth, average prose.
- **Variance, not synonym-swapping.** It targets the real signature of
  machine text (uniform rhythm) rather than relocating it with a thesaurus.
- **Voice-first.** When a writing sample or a `VOICE.md` / `STYLE-GUIDE.md`
  is present, it rewrites in that author's cadence and stance, not generic
  neutral prose.
- **Opt-in edge.** A stance mode adds opinion and punch on explicit request,
  hard-blocked from inventing content.

## What it removes

A 32-pattern catalog in six families, each with detect / why / before-after /
restraint notes: inflated significance, promotional and evasive language,
formulaic structure, lexical tics, syntactic tics, and formatting artifacts,
including chat-UI contamination, debunking-pose headings, and diff-anchored
writing.

## Supported tools

| Tool | File it reads | Install |
|---|---|related:
  - methods/最强去AI味铁律.md
  - methods/改稿润色指令库.md
---|
| Claude Code | `SKILL.md` | `cp -r` this repo to `~/.claude/skills/humanizer/`, or use the repo in-project |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/humanizer.mdc` | Open this repo in Cursor, or copy `.cursor/rules/humanizer.mdc` + `SKILL.md` + `references/` into your project |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` | Clone this repo into (or beside) your project; Codex reads `AGENTS.md` |
| Antigravity | `AGENTS.md` | Same as Codex: keep `AGENTS.md` + `SKILL.md` + `references/` in the workspace |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` | Keep `GEMINI.md` + `SKILL.md` + `references/` in the project Gemini runs in |
| Pi Coder | `AGENTS.md` | Point Pi Coder at this repo / its `AGENTS.md` |
| OpenCode | `AGENTS.md` or `SKILL.md` | Copy the skill into OpenCode's skills directory, or keep `AGENTS.md` in the project |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Copy `.github/copilot-instructions.md` + `SKILL.md` + `references/` into the target repository |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` | Keep `.windsurfrules` + `SKILL.md` + `references/` in the project Windsurf opens |
| Cline | `.clinerules` | Keep `.clinerules` + `SKILL.md` + `references/` in the workspace Cline runs in |
| Continue | `.continue/rules/humanizer.md` | Keep `.continue/rules/humanizer.md` + `SKILL.md` + `references/` in the project |
| Zed | `AGENTS.md` or `.continue/rules/humanizer.md` | Zed reads `AGENTS.md` (already present); the Continue rule also applies if used |
| Aider | `CONVENTIONS.md` | `aider --read CONVENTIONS.md`, or set `read: CONVENTIONS.md` in `.aider.conf.yml`; keep `SKILL.md` + `references/` in the repo |

Every adapter points the agent at the same `SKILL.md` and `references/`, so
the workflow is identical across tools. The simplest universal install is to
clone this repository into (or alongside) the project you are writing in.

## Usage

Ask, in plain language, to humanize, de-slop, or fix prose that "reads like
AI," "sounds corporate," or is "too generic," or to make a draft sound like
you or a named author. You do not need to say the word "humanize."

For voice-matched output, do one of:

- paste a sample of the target writing,
- name a well-known author, or
- keep a `VOICE.md` (schema in `references/voice-matching.md`) or a
  `STYLE-GUIDE.md` in the project; it is discovered automatically.

Every run returns the rewritten text plus a short report: what changed, what
was deliberately left alone, a meaning check, and a next step.

## Scope

This skill improves prose quality and authentic voice. It is not designed or
tuned to defeat plagiarism checkers or AI-detection systems, and it names no
detector. Requests framed as passing AI work off as a person's own for a
graded or contractual assessment are reframed toward the quality-and-voice
use the skill actually serves.
