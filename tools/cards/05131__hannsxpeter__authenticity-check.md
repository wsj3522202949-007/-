A standalone, pure-prompt skill that scores how authentically a piece of text
reads as the work of a real human author, and flags the specific spans that
read as AI-generated, AI-templated, or generically derivative. It is just
instructions: `SKILL.md` plus a few reference files. No scripts, no
dependencies, no network access. Its tools are read-only by design.

It is the evaluative counterpart to the `humanizer` skill. This one
diagnoses. It does not rewrite.

## Where this comes from

This skill is the diagnostic half of a pair. Its detection criteria descend
from the voice-preservation logic that powers
[Scriveno](https://github.com/aihxp/scriveno) (formerly Scriven), an
AI-native longform writing, publishing, and translation pipeline whose core
promise is that drafted prose should sound like the writer, not like AI.
[`humanizer`](https://github.com/aihxp/humanizer) lifted the de-slop,
restraint, and voice-matching layer of that pipeline into a standalone
rewrite skill. `authenticity-check` is the read-only counterpart: it applies
the same catalog and the same restraint to *diagnose* rather than transform,
and it vendors humanizer's criteria so the two agree on what a tell is. If
you want the rewrite, use humanizer. If you want the whole writing pipeline,
see Scriveno (npm package: `scriveno-cli`).

## What it does

Given a piece of text, it returns:

- an authenticity band (Reads human / Mixed signals / Reads AI-generated),
- a 0-100 authenticity score (higher means it reads more like a person's own
  work),
- span-level flags, each with the reason it reads as AI-generated,
  AI-templated, or derivative,
- a "Reads as human" section naming what it deliberately did not flag,
- and a caveat that the score is a heuristic read, not proof.

It runs in generic mode by default, and in a voice-deviation mode when you
ask whether a draft still sounds like you (or a named author) and a voice
sample or profile is available.

## The pairing with humanizer (a pair, never a merge)

`authenticity-check` and [`humanizer`](https://github.com/aihxp/humanizer)
are designed to be used together, as separate skills, with a human deciding
between them:

```
authenticity-check  ->  you read the flags and decide  ->  humanizer
   (diagnose)               (judgment, not automation)       (rewrite)
        ^                                                        |
        |________________ re-verify, fresh read _________________|
```

They are deliberately kept apart. A single tool that scores text and then
rewrites it to raise its own score is a detector-gaming loop: it optimizes
prose against a metric instead of improving it for a reader. The humanizer
skill explicitly refuses that loop. Keeping diagnosis and transformation in
two skills, with a person in between, is what prevents the loop from forming.
So this skill never rewrites, never carries a "target score" into a rewrite,
and never instructs humanizer how to move a number. The re-verify step is a
fresh diagnosis of the revised text, not a continuation of the first.

## voiceprint (future bundle, designed for, not built here)

A future product, `voiceprint`, will bundle `humanizer` (transform) and
`authenticity-check` (diagnose) into one combined offering. This repo is
built to compose cleanly into that bundle: no assumption that it is the only
skill installed, clean separation of the skill from its criteria files, and
no global names that collide with humanizer (the skill name, the Cursor rule
filename, and the frontmatter `name` are all `authenticity-check`). The band
vocabulary is chosen to sit alongside humanizer's density language so the two
reports compose without a translation layer. `voiceprint` is not built here;
this repo simply does not block it.

## Vendored criteria and the sync obligation

The detection criteria live canonically in the `humanizer` repo
(`references/tell-patterns.md`, `references/do-not-flag.md`, and
`references/voice-matching.md`). Because `authenticity-check` is a standalone
repo and the humanizer repo must stay untouched, this repo vendors synced
copies of those three files into its own `references/` directory. Each
vendored file carries a header stamp recording that it is a synced copy, that
its canonical upstream is the humanizer repo, and the obligations below.

- **These three files are synced copies, not the source of truth:**
  `references/tell-patterns.md`, `references/do-not-flag.md`,
  `references/voice-matching.md`. Last synced 2026-05-29 from humanizer
  commit `9632cf1`. The stamp records the last criteria sync, not every
  humanizer commit; humanizer changes that do not touch the three vendored
  files (for example, adapter additions) do not require a re-vendor.
- **Re-sync when humanizer's criteria change.** Do not edit the criteria in
  this repo independently. A fix belongs upstream in humanizer and is then
  re-vendored here. Editing the copies in place makes the two repos drift and
  the diagnose/rewrite pair stop agreeing on what a tell is.
- **Reconciliation is planned.** When the `voiceprint` product is built,
  these vendored copies and humanizer's originals will be collapsed into a
  single shared source of truth. Until then, the header stamp on each file is
  the contract.

`references/scoring.md` and `references/examples.md` are native to this repo
(humanizer has no score and no diagnostic examples) and are not synced.

---|
| Claude Code | `SKILL.md` | `cp -r` this repo to `~/.claude/skills/authenticity-check/`, or use the repo in-project |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/authenticity-check.mdc` | Open this repo in Cursor, or copy `.cursor/rules/authenticity-check.mdc` + `SKILL.md` + `references/` into your project |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` | Clone this repo into (or beside) your project; Codex reads `AGENTS.md` |
| Antigravity | `AGENTS.md` | Same as Codex: keep `AGENTS.md` + `SKILL.md` + `references/` in the workspace |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` | Keep `GEMINI.md` + `SKILL.md` + `references/` in the project Gemini runs in |
| Pi Coder | `AGENTS.md` | Point Pi Coder at this repo / its `AGENTS.md` |
| OpenCode | `AGENTS.md` or `SKILL.md` | Copy the skill into OpenCode's skills directory, or keep `AGENTS.md` in the project |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Copy `.github/copilot-instructions.md` + `SKILL.md` + `references/` into the target repository |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` | Keep `.windsurfrules` + `SKILL.md` + `references/` in the project Windsurf opens |
| Cline | `.clinerules` | Keep `.clinerules` + `SKILL.md` + `references/` in the workspace Cline runs in |
| Continue | `.continue/rules/authenticity-check.md` | Keep `.continue/rules/authenticity-check.md` + `SKILL.md` + `references/` in the project |
| Zed | `AGENTS.md` or `.continue/rules/authenticity-check.md` | Zed reads `AGENTS.md` (already present); the Continue rule also applies if used |
| Aider | `CONVENTIONS.md` | `aider --read CONVENTIONS.md`, or set `read: CONVENTIONS.md` in `.aider.conf.yml`; keep `SKILL.md` + `references/` in the repo |

The Cursor rule and the frontmatter `name` are `authenticity-check`, distinct
from humanizer's `humanizer`, so both skills can be installed side by side
without collision. Every adapter points the agent at the same `SKILL.md` and
`references/`, so the workflow is identical across tools. The 13-tool count
includes Zed as a distinct host even though Zed reads adapter files already
present (`AGENTS.md` or the Continue rule); no Zed-specific adapter is needed.

## Usage

Ask, in plain language, whether a text is authentic, whether it reads like AI
or like a person, how human a passage sounds, which parts sound
machine-written, or whether your draft still sounds like you. You do not need
to say "authenticity check." Oblique cues ("does this sound like a bot,"
"something about this feels generated") trigger it too.

For a "does this still sound like me" check, do one of:

- paste a sample of the target writing,
- name a well-known author, or
- keep a `VOICE.md` (schema in `references/voice-matching.md`) or a
  `STYLE-GUIDE.md` in the project; it is discovered automatically.

Every run returns the report: band and score, flagged spans, what was
deliberately not flagged, the score basis, a caveat, and a next step. It
never returns rewritten prose.

## Verification

`evals/evals.json` holds the verification cases (an AI-heavy text, a
voice-deviation check, a restraint case, a detector-evasion refusal, an
oblique trigger, and a diagnose-then-"just fix it" boundary). `evals/RESULTS.md`
records a blind verification battery: every case run as an isolated diagnosis
with no access to the expected answer, plus a known-vs-non-known battery and a
relocated-signature regression set. The regression set exists because the
hardest case is the one that matters most: AI prose with the slop vocabulary
removed but the uniform rhythm kept must still read low, while genuine careful
human prose, even when formal and clean, must not be over-flagged. These files
are documentation and verification only; they are not part of the runtime
skill.

On short inputs (a single paragraph or two), the internal-consistency pass
(Pass 3) needs at least three comparable chunks and is skipped; Step 0b plus
Passes 1-2 carry the read, with the relocated-signature override holding
short marker-free uniform inputs in the low band.

## Scope

This skill gives an honest read of how authentically text reads as a person's
work. It is not designed or tuned to defeat plagiarism checkers or
AI-detection systems, and it names no detector. Requests framed as getting
AI work past a graded or contractual assessment are reframed toward the honest
diagnostic the skill actually serves. The diagnostic-only boundary is part of
that guarantee: because the skill never rewrites and never carries a score
into a transformation, it cannot be turned into a score-then-rewrite gaming
loop.
