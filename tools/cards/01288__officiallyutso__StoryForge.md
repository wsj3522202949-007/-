| Story Generation Interface | An intuitive form where writers can input their desired story parameters. Users select or type in a specific tone (e.g., Mysterious), genre (e.g., Science Fiction), and topic (e.g., Time Travel). The drag-and-drop suggestions make it easy to explore creative combinations and overcome writer's block. | ![Story Generation Interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b212b71-971e-4969-879b-d8d639a802a4) |
| Multiple Plot Generation | After submitting story parameters, the AI generates multiple unique plot outlines. Each plot is numbered and presented with a select button, allowing writers to explore different narrative possibilities. This feature helps writers find inspiration and choose a direction that resonates with their creative vision. | ![Plot Generation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f236e270-1ef9-4776-860d-8b655414b3bd) |
| Story Expansion and Refinement | Once a plot is selected, the AI expands the outline into a more detailed story. The generated narrative is divided into sections, providing a structured and comprehensive storytelling experience. Each section offers a different aspect of the story, from character development to plot progression. | ![Generated Story](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e2bc364-e2b4-4c4f-8f5f-76b2dcc91fac) |
| Story Editing and Download | A powerful editing feature allows writers to modify their generated story directly in the application. Users can edit story sections, rearrange content, and refine the narrative. The download functionality enables saving the story as a .txt file, making it easy to transfer the work to other writing platforms or continue editing offline. | ![Story Editing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74355a99-46df-42a1-86fe-ea08ad3d77cd) |

## Key Components

### Backend (app.py)

The Flask application handles two primary routes:

1. `/generate_stories`: Generates multiple story outlines based on user-provided parameters
   - Inputs: Tone, Genre, Topic
   - Uses Mira SDK to execute story generation flow

2. `/improve_story`: Refines a selected story outline
   - Inputs: Plot, Tone, Genre, Topic
   - Generates more detailed story sections

### Frontend (script.js)

Manages user interactions:
- Theme toggling
- Drag-and-drop suggestions
- Story generation workflow
- Story editing and download functionality

### Particle Background (particles.js)

Creates an interactive particle animation with:
- Customizable particle count
- Interactive hover and click effects
- Responsive design

## User Workflow

1. Select or input story tone, genre, and topic
2. Generate story outlines
3. Choose a plot outline
4. Refine and generate full story
5. Edit and download the final story
