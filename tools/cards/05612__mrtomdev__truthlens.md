# TruthLens — AI Toxicity & Synthetic Media Detection (Browser Extension)

## Why TruthLens exists

Generative AI now writes news articles, fakes voices, and clones faces faster than platforms can moderate. The result: a flood of **convincing deepfakes, automated scams, and localized disinformation** that overwhelm fact-checkers, journalists, and ordinary readers.

TruthLens gives every internet user a **lightweight, transparent, second opinion** — right in the browser. It does not promise certainty (no detector can), but it surfaces the **signals** that distinguish AI-generated content from human-made content, so you can decide for yourself.

### Built for:

- 📰 **Journalists** verifying sources and quotes
- 🎓 **Teachers & professors** flagging AI homework and plagiarism
- 🛡 **Researchers** studying disinformation at scale
- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Parents** protecting kids from synthetic media
- 🗳 **Voters** spotting election-cycle deepfakes
- 💼 **Recruiters** detecting AI-generated cover letters
- 🌍 **Everyone** living through the synthetic-media era

## ✨ Features

| Capability | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🧠 **AI text detection** | Scans articles, comments, and reviews for LLM fingerprints: burstiness, common-word ratio, phrase signatures, syntactic uniformity. |
| 🖼 **Deepfake / synthetic image detection** | Pixel-level analysis: high-frequency energy, color-histogram entropy, noise-uniformity. Plus known-AI-host detection (Midjourney, DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, Leonardo, Ideogram). |
| 🎙 **Cloned voice detection** | Spectral flatness, silence regularity, and pitch-jitter analysis on audio and video elements. |
| 🏷 **Inline badges** | Clear ⚠ warning badges right next to suspect content — click for a full signal breakdown. |
| 📊 **Floating verdict panel** | Per-page summary of flagged text, images, and audio. |
| ⌨ **Keyboard shortcut** | `Ctrl+Shift+T` (`⌘+Shift+T` on Mac) to re-scan any page. |
| 🧰 **Right-click scan** | Context-menu integration for selective scanning. |
| 🔒 **Zero telemetry** | All analysis runs locally. Nothing is sent to a server. Ever. |
| 🌐 **Works everywhere** | Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Arc, Vivaldi — any Chromium-based browser. |

## 🚀 Quick install (developer mode)

1. Clone or download this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrtomdev/truthlens.git
   ```
2. Open `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://extensions`, `brave://extensions`).
3. Toggle **Developer mode** (top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `truthlens` folder.
5. Pin TruthLens to your toolbar and start scanning.

> A signed Chrome Web Store release is on the roadmap once we finish the public beta.

## 🧪 How it works

TruthLens is **deliberately transparent**. Every verdict comes with the underlying signal scores so you can audit the decision.

### Text detection (`detectors/text-detector.js`)

LLM output exhibits measurable statistical fingerprints — even when the topic is short:

| Signal | What it measures | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Burstiness** | Variance in sentence length | Humans alternate short and long sentences. LLMs cluster around a median. |
| **Common-word ratio** | Share of high-frequency tokens | LLMs over-rely on common words ("the", "of", "and"). |
| **Phrase fingerprints** | 25+ known LLM phrases (`delve into`, `tapestry`, `it's important to note`, `in conclusion`, etc.) | LLM-tuning incentivises a recognisable vocabulary. |
| **Repetition** | Bigram and trigram repetition ratio | Templated outputs repeat phrases at characteristic rates. |
| **Syntactic uniformity** | Diversity of sentence openings | LLMs reuse a narrow set of clause-starters. |

Scores are weighted and combined into a final 0–1 confidence. Anything above 0.72 is flagged **likely AI**.

### Image detection (`detectors/image-detector.js`)

Heuristics targeting the most reliable diffusion / GAN tells:

| Signal | Method |
|---|---|
| **High-frequency energy** | Sobel-based edge magnitude. Diffusion outputs are unusually smooth. |
| **Color entropy** | 64-bin RGB histogram entropy. Synthetic images cluster more tightly. |
| **Noise uniformity** | Coefficient-of-variation of per-block luminance std-dev. Real cameras have spatially varying noise; diffusion does not. |
| **Provenance hints** | Known AI host detection (Midjourney CDN, DALL·E blob storage, Leonardo, Ideogram, Replicate, etc.). |
| **Filename/alt-text hints** | Common patterns (`mj_*`, `sd_*`, `flux-*`, `ai-generated`). |

### Audio detection (`detectors/audio-detector.js`)

Voice clones share three weaknesses:

| Signal | Method |
|---|---|
| **Spectral flatness** | Geometric/arithmetic-mean ratio per window — TTS spectra are flatter. |
| **Silence regularity** | Coefficient-of-variation of pause durations. Synthesised speech has unnaturally uniform pauses. |
| **Pitch jitter** | Zero-crossing-rate variance. Human voices jitter; TTS smooths it. |

> ⚠ **Honesty notice.** These are heuristics, not forensic proof. They produce false positives and false negatives. TruthLens is a *first-pass triage*, not a courtroom verdict. The signals are open and documented precisely so you can verify the reasoning.

## 🛡 Privacy

- **All detection runs in your browser.** Audio, images, and text are never uploaded.
- **No telemetry, no analytics, no remote logging.** Open the network tab and watch.
- **No accounts.** No sign-up. No "free trial".
- **Open source.** Read every line. Audit every commit.
- The only thing stored is **your settings** (Chrome's sync storage) and a **local count** of how many items you've flagged.

**Tech stack:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES modules). No bundler. No framework. No tracking SDK. ~30KB minified.

## 🧪 Run the tests

The detectors are pure functions and can be exercised in plain Node:

```bash
node tests/text-detector.test.js
```

---

## 🗺 Roadmap

- [ ] WebAssembly port of the image detector for 5× speed
- [ ] Optional ONNX-based classifier (loaded only on demand, still on-device)
- [ ] C2PA Content Credentials verification
- [ ] Firefox / Safari ports
- [ ] Translation-aware text detection
- [ ] Browser-native deepfake video frame sampling
- [ ] Curated "known-AI publication" allow/deny list
- [ ] Localised LLM-fingerprint dictionaries (Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Urdu, Arabic)

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs are welcome — especially:

- New phrase fingerprints (with sources / examples)
- Additional known-AI hosts / CDNs
- Better pixel-level heuristics
- Localisations
- Reproducible test cases (real vs. AI examples)

Open an issue first for anything larger than a bug fix.

## 📖 Press & coverage

If you're a journalist writing about generative-AI detection, deepfakes, or media literacy, feel free to reach out. The project's design and limitations are intentionally documented so the conversation can be honest about what detection can and cannot do today.
