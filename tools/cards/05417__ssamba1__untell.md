# untell — the open-source AI humanizer that *closes the loop*

### Iteratively rewrite AI-generated text against live AI-detector scores until it reads human — while keeping your meaning, citations, and facts intact.

A **closed-loop, detector-feedback** AI humanizer, shipped as a **Claude Code skill** *and* a Python CLI.
Free. Open source. Honest about what it can and can't do.

**Optimize against real detectors — with the detector *in the loop*, not blind guessing.** Out of the box it
beats the **free web checkers** (ZeroGPT, live-proven 100%→0%). To actually beat **GPTZero · Originality.ai ·
Turnitin-class · Copyleaks**, you wire *their* API into the loop (key-gated, paid) — the bundled **local
proxies alone do *not* predict those, and we [say so plainly](#honest-caveats)** rather than fake a "99% human."

## TL;DR

Most "AI humanizers" do **one blind paraphrase pass** and plateau at 60–80% detector bypass. This one runs a
**loop**: it *scores* your text against an ensemble of real AI detectors, *rewrites* using each detector's
score as feedback (targeting the exact sentences that read as AI), and *re-scores* — repeating until the
hardest detector stops flagging it **and** a semantic-similarity gate confirms the meaning is unchanged.

That iterative, detector-feedback approach is the strongest *training-free* technique in the published
literature ([arXiv 2506.07001](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07001): −88% TPR@1%FPR, transfers across detectors,
preserves meaning) — and **no shipping tool, open or commercial, actually does it.** This repo does.

```bash
# Zero dependencies. Works right now, in Claude Code:
/untell  <paste your AI-sounding text or a file path>
```

---

## ⚡ Quick start

**Try it free, no install:** paste text into the **[in-browser AI detector](https://ssamba1.github.io/untell/demo.html)**
for an instant AI-tell score (runs locally, nothing uploaded).

**Install the Claude Code skill — one line:**

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssamba1/untell/main/install.sh | sh
# Windows PowerShell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssamba1/untell/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then in Claude Code: **`/untell <your text or a file path>`**. Claude is the rewriter; the bundled scripts
score the text and lock your facts. Zero dependencies (lite tier).

**Or install as a Claude Code plugin** (marketplace):

```text
/plugin marketplace add ssamba1/untell
/plugin install untell@untell
```

**As a Python package** (`pip install untell` lands with the first PyPI release — from source today):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ssamba1/untell && cd untell
pip install -e ".[full]"                          # real detector ensemble on CPU

# One unified command (run `untell` with no args to see them all):
untell humanize "Your AI-sounding paragraph here."   # the closed loop (alias: loop)
untell humanize "text" --rewriter surgical           # NO key needed — runs the loop for $0
untell score "text" --tier full --threshold 0.3      # just score it
untell tells "text"                                  # count the AI writing tells (naturalness)
untell verify --file draft.txt                       # honest pass/fail per detector
untell compare                                       # head-to-head vs free-humanizer techniques
untell ceiling --rewriter surgical --tier full       # measure free evasion of the local ensemble

# (every subcommand is also a standalone `untell-<name>` script, e.g. `untell-loop`, `untell-tells`)
```

> **How far does free actually go?** We measured it. The training-free, no-key loop drops the local
> open-detector ensemble from ~90% flagged to ~60% (mean max P(AI) 0.87 → 0.68) — and is
> **powerless against content-locked detectors**, which no meaning-preserving rewrite can move. The

<summary>Manual / MCP install</summary>

```bash
# Manual skill copy:

# MCP server (Claude Desktop & any MCP client) — exposes score/sentences/untell/verify/scrub as tools:

```
</details>

---

## How it works

```
/untell <text|file>
  preserve-lock citations / numbers / quotes / URLs / entities   (scripts/preserve.py)
  scrub hidden watermark / zero-width / homoglyph characters from the input
  repeat up to N times:
    score = scripts/score.py <text>          # ensemble of detectors -> {detector: P(AI), max}
    sentences = scripts/sentences.py <text>  # which sentences read as AI (target only these)
    sim   = scripts/quality.py <orig> <text> # semantic similarity, must stay >= 0.76
    if max(score) < threshold and sim ok: stop
    Claude rewrites the flagged sentences using the per-detector scores as feedback
      (raise burstiness + perplexity, vary sentence architecture, kill clichés/formulaic
       transitions, diversify vocab — while keeping meaning + every locked span)
  restore locked spans -> humanized text + a before/after detector table
```

Three design choices make it work where blind paraphrasers fail:

1. **It drives the `max` across detectors, not the average** — a rewrite only wins when the *hardest*
   detector is satisfied (genuine multi-detector evasion).
2. **Every rewrite is gated on a 0.76 semantic-similarity bar** (the P-SP threshold from the
   watermark-removal literature) — it *refuses* the meaning-mangling that wrecks other tools' output.
3. **Citations, numbers, quotes, URLs and named entities are locked byte-for-byte** via preserve-lock, so
   your APA/IEEE/MLA references and your facts survive the rewrite untouched.

## 📉 The measured free ceiling

*How far does $0 actually get you? We measured it.* Most humanizers sell a fantasy ("99% human, undetectable!"). We did the opposite: we **measured** the
real ceiling of a free, training-free loop and published the numbers, the method, and the limits.
The published state of the art (92–97.6% attack success) **needs GPU fine-tuning**; the literature had
**no data point** for the inference-only regime this tool runs in. With a working local detector stack we
produced it — see **[`docs/free-ceiling-measured.md`](https://github.com/ssamba1/untell/blob/main/docs/free-ceiling-measured.md)** (research:
**[`docs/free-ceiling-report.md`](https://github.com/ssamba1/untell/blob/main/docs/free-ceiling-report.md)**).

Reproduce it yourself, no API key, on CPU:

```bash
untell-ceiling --rewriter surgical --tier full      # ~90s; deterministic; $0
```

| Free, no-key rewrite vs the local open ensemble (n=10) | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| flagged rate (max P(AI) ≥ 0.30) | 0.90 | **0.60** |
| mean max P(AI) | 0.87 | **0.68** |

Two findings, both measured and both the *opposite* of the marketing:

- **Surface edits strip the lexical tell but not the content tell.** Word-substitution moves the
  perplexity detector (0.32 → 0.20) and RoBERTa-OpenAI (0.52 → 0.36), but a **content/genre** detector
  (HC3-RoBERTa) barely budges (0.73 → 0.67). No meaning-preserving rewrite can move it — *the content is
  the tell.*
- **The local proxies partly anti-correlate with human-ness.** A rewrite that reads *obviously* more human
  scored **higher** on the proxy (0.578 → 0.918). So a low local score means "passed the weak local
  proxies," not "reads human" and **not** "beats GPTZero." That's exactly why the loop treats the local
  score as a weak hint and gates hard on meaning instead.

**The honest ceiling:** for free you can reliably strip the lexical/perplexity tells and clear the *free*
web checkers; you cannot strip the content tell, and clearing the local proxies does not imply clearing
GPTZero / Originality / Turnitin (which need their API in the loop — paid). The tool says so, everywhere.

## 🏆 Why this is the best open-source AI humanizer

We surveyed **~110 open-source humanizer repos** (GitHub topics, papers-with-code, the research SOTA) as part
of building this project. That deep-research survey ([`humanizer-research-report.md`](https://github.com/ssamba1/untell/blob/main/humanizer-research-report.md)) concluded, verbatim:

> *"There is **no** open-source repo that combines (a) a real evasion approach validated against multiple
> live detectors, (b) a quality/meaning-preservation verifier, (c) an iterative detector-feedback loop at
> inference time, and (d) a user-installable package."*

**This is the repo that has all four.** Here it is against the strongest open competitors:

| Capability | **untell (this repo)** | lynote (1.4k★) | patina (196★) | StealthHumanizer (58★) | harshaneel (51★) | Aboudjem (97★) | StealthRL (research) |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Inference-time **detector-feedback loop** | ✅ | ❌ | ◑ own score | ◑ multi-pass | ◑ manual | ❌ | ◑ train-time |

| License | MIT | MIT | MIT | MIT | MIT | MIT | MIT |

**Stars are not capability.** lynote (1.4k★) is an unvalidated translation chain with no loop or verifier;
the highest-starred repos win on SEO, not architecture. The full, evidenced breakdown — including the *one*
place we're honestly **not** #1 (StealthRL's GPU-trained RL policy is a stronger raw *attack model*, though
it's a training framework, not a usable tool) — is in **[docs/why-best-open-repo.md](https://github.com/ssamba1/untell/blob/main/docs/why-best-open-repo.md)**
and the ~110-repo capability audit in **[docs/competitive-gap-plan.md](https://github.com/ssamba1/untell/blob/main/docs/competitive-gap-plan.md)**.

**vs the *free SaaS* humanizers** (Undetectable, QuillBot, HIX Bypass, Humanize AI Pro, …): they all
reduce to 3–4 mechanisms we already implement, so we benchmark them apples-to-apples and measure that
our loop is the **only** technique that drives the AI-tells rate to **zero while preserving meaning**.
Their "99% bypass" claims don't survive independent testing (Originality flags the top "free" tool at
**100% AI**). The reproducible head-to-head, the catalog, and the honest verdict:
**[docs/humanizer-comparison.md](https://github.com/ssamba1/untell/blob/main/docs/humanizer-comparison.md)**.

## Tiers

The scripts auto-detect what's installed and **degrade gracefully** — the score JSON reports which `tier`
actually ran, so you always know how much to trust the number.

| Tier | Install | Detectors | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **lite** | *(default — nothing to install)* | perplexity + burstiness heuristic; token-overlap quality | Stdlib only, instant, **weak** — a demo signal, not an evasion claim. |
| **full** | `pip install -e ".[full]"` | + RoBERTa-OpenAI, HC3-RoBERTa, MAGE, Fast-DetectGPT, GPT-2 perplexity; MiniLM cosine quality | Real proxy signal on CPU. Downloads models on first run. |
| **+ RADAR** | `UNTELL_ENABLE_RADAR=1` (opt-in) | + RADAR — the **paraphrase-robust** detector, the hardest open one to fool | ⚠️ `TrustSafeAI/RADAR-Vicuna-7B` is **non-commercial licensed** — research/eval only. |
| **heavy** | `pip install -e ".[heavy]"` | + Binoculars (2×Falcon-7B) | Strongest proxy; GPU recommended. Eval only. |
| **commercial** | `pip install -e ".[commercial]"` + your keys | + Originality.ai, GPTZero, Winston, Sapling, ZeroGPT, Copyleaks, **LLM-as-judge** | The real checkers. Key-gated; nothing runs or bills unless you set a key. LLM-as-judge = a frontier model rates AI-likelihood against the ai-tells catalog (often the best free-of-proxy signal). |

```bash
untell-score "Your text here" --tier full --threshold 0.3
echo "piped text" | untell-score
```

---

## Passing the real commercial detectors

Local detectors are *proxies*. To optimize for the checkers people actually care about — **GPTZero,
Originality.ai, Turnitin-class, Copyleaks, ZeroGPT, Winston, Sapling** — wire the real APIs. Each is
**key-gated**; nothing runs or bills unless you set its key.

```bash
pip install -e ".[commercial]"
export GPTZERO_API_KEY=...      ORIGINALITY_API_KEY=...   WINSTON_API_KEY=...
export SAPLING_API_KEY=...      ZEROGPT_API_KEY=...       COPYLEAKS_EMAIL=...  COPYLEAKS_API_KEY=...

untell-loop  "text" --tier commercial      # rewrite until EVERY configured checker passes
untell-verify "text" --threshold 0.30      # pass/fail per checker + overall verdict (exit 0 = all pass)
untell-prove "Your AI text" --margin 0.10  # verify → loop → re-verify: one before/after table
```

`untell-verify` exits `0` only when **every** configured checker scores under the threshold. `untell-prove`
runs the whole thing end-to-end so you get an honest before/after AI% per checker. (Each `--tier commercial`
iteration calls every checker, so it **costs API credits** — cap with `--max-iters`.)

### Free ways to test without paying

```bash
# No key at all — deterministic CPU word-substitution rewriter drives the loop ($0, no SDK):
untell-loop "text" --rewriter surgical --tier full
untell-ceiling --rewriter surgical --tier full     # measure the loop vs the local ensemble

# Optimize against a REAL detector for free via its web UI (slow, needs a browser):
pip install -e ".[browser]" && playwright install chromium
untell-verify --browser zerogpt "text"     # drives the free ZeroGPT web UI — no API key, $0
untell-loop   "text" --browser zerogpt      # iterate against the LIVE ZeroGPT detector until it clears
```

The **`--rewriter surgical`** path makes the whole loop runnable with **no API key, no GPU, no model
download** — the bundled deterministic rewriter (PWWS/TextFooler-style word-importance substitution)
stands in for the hosted LLM. Weaker than Claude-as-rewriter, but it's what makes the free measurement
above reproducible. (In Claude Code, `/untell` uses Claude itself as the rewriter — also free.)

The `--browser` path drives a real headless browser through a free web checker and reads the % score.
**ZeroGPT ships built-in** (confirmed working live). Most other free detectors are now bot-gated
(reCAPTCHA / login-redirect / iframe widgets) — see [docs/free-detector-probes.md](https://github.com/ssamba1/untell/blob/main/docs/free-detector-probes.md).
Add your own site with **zero code** — it's just CSS selectors in a JSON file
([examples/browser_sites.example.json](https://github.com/ssamba1/untell/blob/main/examples/browser_sites.example.json)).

> ⚠️ Browser checking is **slow, fragile, and ToS-caveated** — for occasional checks on your own text, not
> the hot loop. The reliable multi-detector path is the key-gated commercial tier.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is there a free AI humanizer that actually works?</b></summary>

Yes — the lite tier installs with **zero dependencies** and the `--browser zerogpt` path optimizes against a
real detector for **$0**. "Actually works," honestly: the loop reliably clears the *free* web detectors
(ZeroGPT live-measured 100%→0%), and the full/commercial tiers optimize against the harder ones. No tool —
this one included — can promise it passes *every* commercial detector forever; the ones that claim "99%
human" are lying. This repo tells you the real per-detector score instead.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it bypass GPTZero / ZeroGPT / Turnitin / Originality.ai?</b></summary>

It *optimizes and verifies against* them. ZeroGPT is built into the free browser path and live-proven.
GPTZero, Originality.ai, Turnitin-class, Copyleaks, Winston and Sapling are wired as **key-gated commercial
adapters** — the loop drives the max across every checker you configure below threshold. Originality.ai is
genuinely the hardest (the research literature and public benchmarks consistently rank it the toughest to evade); we don't
claim to beat it without your API key to prove it. Honesty is the point.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Will it ruin my meaning, citations, or numbers?</b></summary>

No — that's the core differentiator. A **semantic-similarity gate** rejects any rewrite that drifts too far
from the original meaning, and **preserve-lock** freezes citations, numbers, quotes, URLs and named entities
byte-for-byte. Other humanizers are known to inject grammar errors and even reverse facts when they paraphrase
blindly; this one refuses meaning-breaking rewrites by design. Good for academic / legal / ESL writing.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How is this different from Undetectable.ai / QuillBot / WriteHuman?</b></summary>

Those are closed SaaS that do a single blind pass and report a fake binary "human/AI." This is open source,
runs a **closed detector-feedback loop**, optimizes against **multiple real detectors at once**, gates on
**meaning preservation**, and gives you an **honest, reproducible per-detector score** instead of a marketing
claim. It's a research/defensive tool you can read, audit, and run yourself.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is this against the rules / ethical?</b></summary>

AI detectors are noisy proxies — they falsely flag non-native English writers at high rates (~61% in some
Stanford-cited studies). This exists as a **research harness and a defense against false positives**, not an
academic-dishonesty aid. Don't use it to misrepresent authorship where that's prohibited. See the caveats
below — we mean them.
</details>

## Eval harness (research)

Validates the thesis — closed loop beats single-pass — without a human in the seat (a scripted rewriter
stands in for Claude so it's measurable):

```bash
pip install -e ".[full,eval]"
python -m eval.benchmark --dataset builtin --n 5                      # zero-download smoke run
python -m eval.benchmark --dataset raid --n 200 --tier full --enable-radar   # adversarial: hardest detector + RAID

untell-ceiling --rewriter surgical --tier full       # measure free inference-only evasion (no key, $0)
untell-eval-policy --policy out/rl-humanizer --vs-base   # A/B a trained LoRA policy vs the untuned base
```

The report shows **per-detector beat-rates** and names the **hardest detector to beat** (the honest
headline). `untell-ceiling` measures how far the free loop moves the local ensemble (see the
[measured ceiling](#-the-measured-free-ceiling)); `untell-eval-policy`
scores the optional GPU-trained single-pass policy (`training/`) against held-out text.
`--enable-radar` adds the paraphrase-robust RADAR detector (non-commercial — research/eval only).
For broader cross-detector benchmarking, [IMGTB](https://github.com/kinit-sk/IMGTB) + the
[RAID](https://github.com/liamdugan/raid) leaderboard are the standard references.

ruff check .
pytest -q
```

CI runs a **lite** matrix (ruff + pytest, no downloads) across Python 3.9/3.11/3.12 **and** a **full-tier**
job (Ubuntu, CPU torch + `.[full,eval]`) that loads the real RoBERTa / Fast-DetectGPT / GPT-2 detectors and
runs the torch-gated tests. See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ssamba1/untell/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)** to get involved and
**[ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/ssamba1/untell/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)** for what's next (the GPU RL-against-ensemble moat).

## Troubleshooting

**Full-tier detectors come back as `null`, you see `failed_detectors`, or a "NumPy 2.x" warning.**
The supervised detectors load `torch`/`transformers`; older builds of those were compiled against
NumPy 1.x and crash on import when NumPy 2.x is present. untell **excludes** any detector that fails to
load — it never fakes a neutral `0.5` that would silently pin your score — lists it under
`failed_detectors`, and honestly downgrades the reported `tier` (so a broken full-tier run reports
`lite`, not a fake `full`). To get the full ensemble back, align the versions, ideally in a fresh venv:

```bash
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/Scripts/activate     # (. .venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux)
pip install -e ".[full]"            # pulls torch/transformers matched to your NumPy
# …or pin NumPy down in an existing env:
pip install "numpy<2"
```

**`mage` is always `null`.** `yaful/MAGE` ships a config current `huggingface_hub` rejects (`id2label`
validation). It's auto-excluded and the rest of the ensemble runs normally — nothing you need to fix.

**Full tier feels slow.** Each `untell-score` call loads the models fresh, and the first run downloads
~0.5 GB of weights (cached after that). For a multi-iteration run prefer the single-process headless
loop — `untell-loop` loads the models once — over many one-off score calls. The **lite** tier and the
[in-browser demo](https://ssamba1.github.io/untell/demo.html) need no downloads at all.

## Honest caveats

- **Proxy ≠ commercial.** The local detectors approximate; they aren't Originality.ai / Turnitin. The
  ensemble is a *signal*, not a verdict. "Passes all checkers" is unprovable against detectors you don't run.
- **Local proxies do NOT predict GPTZero / Originality.** Measured: a rewrite the bundled local ensemble rates
  *low* can still score **100% AI on GPTZero**, which runs dedicated anti-humanizer ("AI Paraphrasing")
  detection. A low local `max` means "passed the weak local proxies," **not** "undetectable." The only way to
  optimize for a specific commercial detector is to put **it** in the loop (`--tier commercial` + its API key)
  — and even then GPTZero/Originality are the hardest and nobody beats them reliably.
- **lite is a demo.** The zero-install heuristic shows the loop; it's not an evasion claim. The full tier is
  the honest baseline; Binoculars (GPU) is the strongest proxy.
- **Claude is the rewriter.** Output quality and evasion depend on the running model.
- **Ethics.** Detector false-positives disproportionately harm non-native writers. This is a research/eval
  harness and a defense against that — not a plagiarism or academic-dishonesty aid.
