## ✨ What is The Writer?

**The Writer** is a self-hosted, AI-assisted writing studio that plans, drafts, revises, and typesets long-form documents from a single prompt. Give it a title, a premise, and a few notes — it handles outlining, chapter-by-chapter drafting, continuity checking, and final PDF production, all inside a clean, live-updating dashboard.

Whether you're drafting a novel, assembling a poetry collection, or producing a polished executive report, The Writer turns a blank page into a finished, print-ready document.

> 🔒 **Privacy first.** Every generation runs against a local AI model on your own machine. Nothing is ever uploaded to a third-party service.

## 🤖 Models

The Writer is **model-agnostic** — it talks to whatever you have running in Ollama. Nothing is hardcoded to a single vendor.

- **Writing / Reasoning:** any chat-capable model pulled into Ollama (e.g. `llama3.1:8b` or your preferred local model)
- **Embeddings:** any Ollama embedding-capable model for knowledge base search
- **Vision / OCR:** any local vision model for scanned documents and images

Check what's installed and available at any time from inside the dashboard, or via:

```bash
ollama list
```

Pull a new model:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
ollama pull dolphin3:8b
ollama pull neural-chat:7b
ollama pull phi3:latest
ollama pull glm-ocr:q8_0
ollama pull mathstral:7b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest
ollama pull qwen3.5:latest
