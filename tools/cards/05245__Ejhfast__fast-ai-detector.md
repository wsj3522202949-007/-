# fast-ai-detector

`fast-ai-detector` is a local CLI for predicting whether text was AI-written. The core model is a very small distilled transformer (~40M param) that approximates mean-pooled residual representations from a larger (4B param) [Gemma model](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-4b-pt). Those residual-style outputs can be annotated with SAE features from the original Gemma model's interpretability stack. Contrast vectors were computed from the [RAID](https://raid-bench.xyz/) training dataset.

I wrote up the origins of this work [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/ethanfast/p/a-tiny-model-for-fast-interpretability).

Modes:
- `contrast` (default): contrast-based prediction and SAE-based document feature inspection
- `raid-finetune`: the core transformer model finetuned with a classifier head (trained on the RAID dataset)

Current reference numbers:

| Dataset | Mode | Balanced Accuracy | ROC-AUC | TPR @ 5% FPR |

---: |
| RAID held-out validation | `contrast` | `0.8078` | `0.9343` | `0.7637` |
| RAID held-out validation | `raid-finetune` | `0.9642` | `0.9958` | `0.9801` |
| Pangram benchmark | `contrast` | `0.8827` | `0.9425` | `0.7856` |
| Pangram benchmark | `raid-finetune` | `0.6731` | `0.8993` | `0.6466` |

The contrast model (default) is recommended for normal use as the raid-finetuned model seems poorly calibrated around the human/ai threshold for text that falls outside the distribution of the RAID training data. 

The pangram benchmark is small and included in this repo for reproducability. 

Note: the bundled benchmarks contain little or no output from GPT-5-era systems and later, so you should not expect these scores to transfer unchanged to the latest model outputs.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

On first use, the selected model bundle is downloaded from Hugging Face and cached locally.

## Scoring

### Direct text

Default output is a compact human-readable table. These are real examples from `examples/pangram_benchmark.csv`.

Human-like Pangram review:

```bash
fast-ai-detector --text "Went there 3 weeks ago, the place was jammed. Service was great food (breakfast) was excellent. We will be going back."
```

```text
mode      label  score       human_ai_scale
contrast  human  -75.602432  38.080172
```

AI-like Pangram review:

```bash
fast-ai-detector --text "I love these stories. The characters are complex and relatable, and the plot twists keep me on the edge of my seat. The writing style is engaging and descriptive, making it easy to immerse myself in the world of the story. Each tale is unique and captivating, and I find myself thinking about them long after I've finished reading. I highly recommend these stories to anyone looking for thought-provoking and entertaining reads."
```

```text
mode      label  score       human_ai_scale
contrast  ai     423.319458  94.671712
```

`human_ai_scale` is a RAID-reference scale, not a probability:

- `0` = strongly human side
- `50` = near the decision boundary
- `100` = strongly AI side

If you want the RAID-specific finetune model instead of the default contrast model:

```bash
fast-ai-detector --mode raid-finetune --device cuda --text "Your text here"
```

For machine-readable direct output:

```bash
fast-ai-detector --text "Your text here" --json
```

### CSV / TSV

The repo includes `examples/pangram_benchmark.csv` as a ready-to-run example dataset.

```bash
fast-ai-detector \
  --input examples/pangram_benchmark.csv \
  --text-column text \
  --output examples/pangram_benchmark_scored.csv
```

The tool preserves the original columns and appends:

- `fast_ai_detector_label`
- `fast_ai_detector_score`
- `fast_ai_detector_human_ai_scale`

Example output rows:

```csv
text,label,tags,fast_ai_detector_label,fast_ai_detector_score,fast_ai_detector_human_ai_scale
"Went there 3 weeks ago, the place was jammed. Service was great food (breakfast) was excellent. We will be going back.",0,"['reviews', None]",human,-75.602432,38.080172
"I love these stories. The characters are complex and relatable, and the plot twists keep me on the edge of my seat.

I highly recommend these stories to anyone looking for thought-provoking and entertaining reads.",1,"['reviews', 'gpt-3.5-turbo-1106']",ai,423.319458,94.671712
```

### Vector Export

You can also use the CLI to export the distilled document representations directly. This is useful if you want to run your own clustering, nearest-neighbor search, contrast-vector experiments, or SAE projection analysis outside the detector.

```bash
fast-ai-detector \
  --input examples/pangram_benchmark.csv \
  --text-column text \
  --export-vectors pangram_vectors.npy
```

By default this writes an `N x 2560` float32 `.npy` matrix containing the student-predicted Gemma 3 4B layer-17 mean residual representation for each row. For `.npy` output, the CLI also writes `pangram_vectors.metadata.csv` with row indices and the original input columns, plus `pangram_vectors.npy.json` with a small manifest.

Supported vector outputs:

- `.npy`: vectors only, plus sidecar metadata and manifest files
- `.npz`: compressed archive containing `vectors`, `row_index`, and `manifest_json`
- `.csv` / `.tsv`: original columns plus `vector_0000` ... `vector_2559`

Available vector spaces:

- `raw` (default): predicted Gemma layer-17 mean residual vector
- `student-z`: raw vector normalized by the student checkpoint's target mean and scale
- `detector-z`: raw vector normalized by the contrast detector's mean and scale

Example:

```bash
fast-ai-detector \
  --input examples/pangram_benchmark.csv \
  --text-column text \
  --export-vectors pangram_detector_z.npz \
  --vector-space detector-z
```

## SAE

`contrast` mode can also expose document-level SAE annotations derived from the Gemma interpretability stack the student was distilled from.

```bash
fast-ai-detector \
  --text "Subject: Exciting New Classes Announcement Dear Valued Students, We are thrilled to announce the launch of our new class offerings!

```

These annotations are intended as document fingerprints in SAE space, not as calibrated probabilities or exact causal attributions.

## Approach

This project grew out of experiments on whether much smaller models could approximate mean-pooled residual representations from larger LLMs closely enough to preserve useful downstream geometry. The resulting detector uses a compact 4-layer student trained to predict a Gemma layer-17 mean-pooled residual representation.

From there, two detector variants were built on top of the student:

- `contrast`: a contrast direction learned in the student's residual space
- `raid-finetune`: a supervised classifier head trained for the RAID benchmark

The main motivation for doing this at all was not just speed. If a small model can stay close enough to the teacher representation, then some of the interpretability infrastructure built around the teacher model can still be reused. That is what powers the optional SAE annotations in `contrast` mode: the small model is fast enough for local use, but the outputs can still be inspected with the teacher's SAE dictionary.
