An AI-powered system for detecting and analyzing OCD patterns in digital communications
</div>

## Overview

OCD Detector is a cutting-edge artificial intelligence system designed to identify and analyze Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) patterns across multiple communication channels. By leveraging advanced machine learning technologies, our system provides valuable insights for mental health professionals and researchers.

![OCD Detector Technologies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skytells-research/ocd-detector/main/assets/ocd-detector.jpeg)

The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) research indicates that individuals with OCD exhibit distinct patterns in their communication and behavioral manifestations[²], including:
- Repetitive thoughts and behaviors
- Specific language patterns and word choices
- Time-consuming rituals that interfere with daily activities
- Persistent intrusive thoughts

Our system aligns with the NIH's dimensional approach to OCD assessment[³], analyzing these patterns across digital communications to support clinical evaluation and research.


### Key Technologies
- 🧠 Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- 👁️ Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- 🎤 Voice Recognition and Analysis
- 🤖 Integration with OpenAI's GPT models
- 📱 CoreML Support for Apple Devices

## Methodology

Our OCD detection system employs sophisticated algorithms and statistical methods to analyze behavioral patterns. 
See [Research](https://github.com/skytells-research/ocd-detector/blob/main/RESEARCH.md) for more details.

The core methodology includes:

### Pattern Recognition
We utilize a modified attention mechanism that weighs behavioral markers ($b_i$) against temporal frequency ($f_t$):

$$
A(b, f) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{b_i \cdot f_t}{\sqrt{d_k}}
$$

where $d_k$ represents the dimensionality of the behavioral space.

### Severity Scoring
The severity score ($S$) is calculated using a weighted combination of detected patterns:

$$
S = \alpha \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i p_i + \beta \log(\frac{f_{obs}}{f_{exp}})
$$

where:
- $w_i$ represents pattern weights
- $p_i$ represents pattern intensities
- $f_{obs}$ is observed frequency
- $f_{exp}$ is expected frequency
- $\alpha, \beta$ are tuning parameters

### Confidence Estimation
Our confidence metric ($C$) incorporates both model uncertainty and data quality:

$$
C = \left(1 - \frac{\sigma_m^2}{\sigma_{max}^2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{n_{valid}}{n_{total}}\right)
$$

where $\sigma_m^2$ represents model variance and $n_{valid}$ represents the number of valid data points.
