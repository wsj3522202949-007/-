## 📖 About

LLM StoryTeller is a Streamlit-based application designed to assist users in creating engaging stories through the power of AI. Instead of simply requesting a story from an LLM, the application guides the language models through a structured three-step process: generating a detailed story outline, crafting the narrative, and refining it for grammar and coherence. This approach ensures higher-quality results compared to a single-step prompt. Additionally, the application is highly customizable, allowing you to select different models, adjust creativity levels, and tailor the story's style and length to your preferences.

To ensure the application functions correctly, you need to have two OpenAI-compatible language models running locally on your machine, configured to serve requests through an endpoint at **http://localhost:7860**. These models should be compatible with OpenAI's API format to handle prompts effectively. If you don't have these models or prefer a different setup, you can modify the `BASE_URL` and `AVAILABLE_MODELS` sections in the code to point to other endpoints or adjust the model names to match your setup.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Guided Multi-Step Process**: Directs LLMs through outlining, writing, and reviewing to ensure higher-quality stories.
- **Model Compatibility**: Easily configure and run OpenAI-compatible models locally, such as Llama or Qwen models, or use the latest free models via OpenRouter.
- **Customizable Story Parameters**: Adjust creativity, choose narrative style, language, and story length.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple and responsive design with clear input fields for seamless interaction.
- **Downloadable Stories**: Save the final story as a text file with a single click.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Modify model endpoints and settings to fit your environment.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/warc0s/llm-storyteller.git
   cd llm-storyteller
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Local Application**

   ```bash
   streamlit run llm_storyteller.py
   ```

5. **Access the App**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

### OpenRouter Version

To run the OpenRouter-backed version locally, configure your Streamlit secret first:

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "your-openrouter-api-key"
```

Then run:

```bash
streamlit run llm_storyteller_openrouter.py
```

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. **Configure Settings**

Navigate to the sidebar to select models for each storytelling step, adjust the temperature for creativity, and set the language of your story.

![Configuration Sidebar](https://github.com/warc0s/llm-storyteller/blob/main/images/settings.png)

### 2. **Input Story Elements**

Fill in the main character, secondary character, location, key action, desired length, and narrative style.

![Input Fields](https://github.com/warc0s/llm-storyteller/blob/main/images/Story_Elements.png)

### 3. **Generate Story**

Click on the "✨ Generar Historia" button. The app will process your inputs through the selected models to create your story.

![Generate Button](https://github.com/warc0s/llm-storyteller/blob/main/images/button.png)

### 4. **Step-by-Step Story Generation**

As the story is being generated, you will see real-time updates for each of the three internal steps:
- **Outline Creation**: The app generates a structured story framework.
- **Story Writing**: The detailed narrative is crafted based on the outline.
- **Review and Refinement**: Grammar, coherence, and overall quality are polished.

Each step's progress is displayed with clear messages, giving you transparency and confidence in the process.

![Generation Steps](https://github.com/warc0s/llm-storyteller/blob/main/images/pasos.png)

### 5. **View and Download**

Once generated, your story will be displayed in a formatted container. You can download the final version as a `.txt` file by clicking on the button "📩 Descargar Historia".

## ⚙️ Configuration

LLM StoryTeller offers various configuration options to tailor your storytelling experience:

### **Model Selection**

The **online version** now features updated free models: **Nemotron Nano 9B**, **Llama 3.3 8B**, **GPT OSS 20B**, and **Gemma 3n E2B**, providing more powerful and diverse options for story generation.

The **local version** currently supports **Llama 1B** and **Qwen 1.5B**, optimized by default for these smaller models running on CPUs. These options ensure compatibility and performance in a lightweight setup.

If you'd like to use other models or endpoints, you can customize the application by modifying the `BASE_URL` and `AVAILABLE_MODELS` variables in the `llm_storyteller.py` file. This allows you to adapt the app to your preferred models or configurations.

- **Outline Model**: Generates the story framework.
- **Writing Model**: Crafts the detailed narrative.
- **Review Model**: Enhances grammar and coherence.

![Model Selection](https://github.com/warc0s/llm-storyteller/blob/main/images/model_selection.png)

### **Temperature Adjustment**

Control the creativity of the generated content. Higher values yield more creative outputs, while lower values ensure consistency.

![Temperature Slider](https://github.com/warc0s/llm-storyteller/blob/main/images/temp_slider.png)

### **Language and Style**

The **Language** field is a flexible text box where you can input any language of your choice without restrictions. This input is directly included in the prompt sent to the LLM, ensuring your story is crafted in the specified language.

Additionally, select the desired narrative **Style** from predefined options such as Mystery, Science Fiction, Romance, Fantasy, and Comedy to tailor the tone and feel of your story.

## 💡 How It Works

To summarize, here’s a clear overview of how LLM StoryTeller works, as this structured approach has proven to be the most effective for generating high-quality stories, especially when using smaller models with limited parameters:

1. **Outline Generation**: The application begins by creating a structured framework based on your inputs. This ensures a clear direction and logical flow for the story.

2. **Story Writing**: The framework is expanded into a detailed and engaging narrative, incorporating the chosen language, style, and length specifications.

3. **Review and Refinement**: Finally, the story is polished for grammatical accuracy, coherence, and overall quality, ensuring the end result is compelling and well-written.

This step-by-step process is optimized for smaller models, ensuring they can perform effectively and deliver results comparable to larger models. By guiding the LLM through these structured phases and incorporating **prompt engineering techniques**, LLM StoryTeller maximizes the potential of the models, ensuring they generate stories of superior quality compared to a single-step prompt.

## 📚 Story Examples

You can explore examples of generated stories (using the cloud version) in the **`examples`** folder. This folder contains three stories, each showcasing the results from different models:

1. **Fantasy Story**: Created entirely (all three steps) using **Gemma 9B**.
   - Demonstrates rich detail and world-building with consistent quality across all phases.

2. **Science Fiction Story**: Generated fully with **Llama 8B**.
   - Highlights Llama's ability to handle suspense and technical narratives effectively.

3. **Comedy Story**: Produced entirely with **Mistral 7B**.
   - This example shows limitations in coherence and creativity, making it the least polished of the three.

**Note:** With the new updated models (**Nemotron Nano 9B**, **Llama 3.3 8B**, **GPT OSS 20B**, and **Gemma 3n E2B**), you can expect even better results. I encourage you to experiment with combining different models for each of the three steps (outline, writing, and refinement) to play to each model's strengths and create more balanced, high-quality stories.
