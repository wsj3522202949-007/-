## What is it?

FocusTide is a Pomodoro timer application running in the browser. It helps you manage your time so that you can do more work instead of watching videos of cute cats 😿

## What you get

Here's the looong list of features this app includes.

### ⏰ **Multiple timer styles**
  * (12:34) _traditional_ <br> a classic one with second-precision for those who want to know exactly how much time is left until coffee break
  * (12 minutes) _approximate_ <br> this one displays time with minute-precision so you know how much time is left but your eyes won't stick to the counter since it does not change every second
  * (50%) _percentage_ <br> being even less informative, this one keeps you away from the distraction of calculating "what can I do in the remaining 12 minutes and 34 seconds?".

### 💡 **Friendly, focused and clean user interface**
**It's just the essentials**: a timer in the middle and controls at the bottom. Everything else can be turned off:
  * a quick glance at your schedule at the top
  * a smart to-do list
  * colour-coded sections
  * colourful progress bar in the background

### 📑 **Flexible schedule**
  * adjust the length of your sessions separately or use one of the built-in presets
  * set how frequent long pauses are
  * **track the time spent beyond the timer**, unlike other timers that stop when the time expires

### 🎵 **Multiple ways to notify you**
  * play sounds when you finish a section
  * desktop notifications so you don't have to keep checking your browser

### ⚙ **Plenty of options**
  * set your schedule the way you want it
  * toggle the schedule view, the progress bar or the to-do list
  * enable/disable audio and/or desktop notifications
  * change the number of schedule items shown
  * control your timer using the keyboard
  * dark and light themes
  * ... and more to come in the future!

### ✅ **Clean to-do list**
  * set separate tasks for work, pause and long pause sections
  * only shows your top relevant tasks while the timer is running
  * automatically remove completed tasks at the end of each session
  * remembers your tasks across sessions

### ✨ **Other nice-to-have features**
  * remembers your settings
  * it's a _PWA_ (Progressive Web App): it's fast and you can install it through your browser!
  * fancy and fluid animations
  * setup wizard to get you started
  * translated into 5 languages

### ✔ **No installation required**. 
Just open the webpage and enjoy it! You can even self-host it!

### 👋 **Open development**
Anyone can view the source code, raise issues (feature requests, bug reports) or even submit their own improvements!

## ⚠ Transparency warning
Production deployments (on Netlify or elsewhere) may use third-party (but privacy-friendly) tools to measure site performance.

The app itself does not collect any data (eg. when you're running it on your own machine) 💪
