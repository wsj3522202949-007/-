# Smart Memory

[![License: AGPL-3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL--3.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/senjinthedragon/Smart-Memory/blob/main/LICENSE)
[![Author: Senjin the Dragon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Author-Senjin_the_Dragon-gold.svg)](https://github.com/senjinthedragon)

Give your AI a memory that lasts. Smart Memory is a SillyTavern extension that quietly works in the background, keeping your AI oriented in long stories, aware of what happened this session, and grounded in facts it has learned across every previous chat with a character - even after weeks away.

It runs automatically. You don't have to do anything special. Just chat, and it takes care of the rest.

Both 1:1 chats and group chats are supported. In group chats, each character gets their own independent memory store and receives their own memories before they respond. A character selector in the settings panel lets you switch between group members to view and manage each character's memories, profiles, and entity registry independently.

_This is an independent extension for SillyTavern and is not affiliated with the SillyTavern development team._

## ☕ Support the Developer

I'm a solo developer building tools to make AI roleplay better for everyone. Smart Memory is maintained in my free time, and as I'm currently navigating some financial challenges, any support means a lot.

If this extension adds something to your stories, please consider:

- **[Sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/senjinthedragon)**
- **[Buying me a coffee on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/senjinthedragon)**
- **Bitcoin:** `bc1qjsaqw6rjcmhv6ywv2a97wfd4zxnae3ncrn8mf9`
- **Starring this repository** to help others find it.

## Installation

- In SillyTavern, open the **Extensions** menu (the stack of cubes icon)
- Click **Install extension**
- Paste: `https://github.com/senjinthedragon/Smart-Memory`
- Click **Install just for me** (or for all users if you're on a shared server)

Restart SillyTavern. **Smart Memory** will appear in your Extensions panel.

## Quick Start

After installing, two things to set up before your first session:

### 1. Pick a memory LLM

Smart Memory needs a language model to do its work - summarizing, extracting facts, generating recaps. It runs this separately from your main roleplay model so the two don't compete. Open the extension panel, scroll down to **Configuration**, and set the **Memory LLM** to whichever source fits your setup. See [Recommended Local Models](#recommended-local-models) for suggestions on what to run locally.

### 2. Set up semantic embeddings (optional but recommended)

Embeddings let Smart Memory compare memories by meaning rather than exact wording, which catches far more duplicates and keeps your memory lists clean. If you already use SillyTavern's Vector Storage with Ollama, you likely have `nomic-embed-text` installed and nothing extra is needed - just make sure **Use semantic embeddings** is enabled in the **Configuration** section. If not, see [Memory Deduplication](#memory-deduplication) for setup instructions.

### 3. Leave the memory context budget alone (for now)

The default **Memory context budget** in simple mode is 3750 tokens - the combined total of all memory tiers at their default sizes. This number was chosen to work well with the recommended local models. If you reduce it, one or more tiers will start getting trimmed or cut off entirely to fit the lower limit, which may noticeably affect quality. Leave it at the default until you have a feel for how Smart Memory works in your setup, then adjust carefully in small steps if needed.

That's it - Smart Memory will start building memories automatically from your next chat.

## What It Does

Smart Memory runs several memory systems in the background, each focused on a different slice of your story's history.

### Token Usage Display

A small bar in the settings panel shows how many tokens each memory tier is currently using in the AI's context. It updates after every response so you can see at a glance whether Smart Memory is taking up a sensible amount of your context.

When a tier is actively trimming content to fit its budget, its segment on the bar shows a red strip along the bottom edge. Hovering over the segment shows how many tokens were dropped. This is your signal to consider raising that tier's injection budget in the settings - or lowering another tier's budget to free up room.

**Auto-tune budgets** adjusts tier budgets automatically based on observed demand. After each injection pass it measures how many tokens each tier actually needed, then sets the budget to that amount plus 15% headroom - enough to stay comfortable without wasting context on unused space. Budgets are never reduced below their defaults, only grown. In group chats it tracks the highest demand seen across all characters in the session, so budgets are sized for the most memory-heavy character rather than whichever one injected last. Enabling auto-tune applies immediately using whatever data has already been collected; after that it re-tunes after every injection pass.

### Long-term Memory - Persistent Facts

Facts, relationship history, preferences, and significant events are extracted from your chats and saved for each character. These memories survive across all sessions - when you open a new chat with a character, everything they have learned is already there waiting.

Over time, memories are automatically consolidated so the same information does not pile up in slightly different forms. Smart Memory is good at recognising when two differently-worded entries are saying the same thing, so you end up with a clean, rich picture of the character rather than a growing cluttered list.

When a new memory describes a change - "Alex no longer distrusts Finn", "she moved to the capital", "the guild was disbanded" - the old fact is automatically retired and replaced rather than left alongside the newer truth as a contradiction.

Each memory is assigned a set of **activation triggers** - keywords derived automatically from its content. When a trigger appears in the current chat turn, that memory gets a scoring boost so it rises to the top of what gets injected into context. Memories that fire a trigger are also placed in a secondary slot closer to the prompt, so the AI sees them right before it responds. You do not need to configure anything for this - it runs automatically.

### Session Memory - Within-Chat Details

Granular details from the current session: scene descriptions, things that were revealed, how the relationship shifted, specific objects or places that came up. More detailed than long-term memory, and scoped to this chat only - it does not carry forward to future sessions, but it keeps the AI sharp on the specifics of what is happening right now.

Session memory is aware of what is already in long-term memory, so the two complement each other rather than duplicating information.

### Short-term Memory - Context Summary

When your conversation grows long enough that older messages start falling out of the AI's awareness, Smart Memory automatically writes a summary of everything so far and keeps it in context. The AI stays oriented in long stories even as older messages scroll away.

After the first summary is written, only new messages get folded in - the summary grows with your story rather than being rewritten from scratch every time. It also knows what is already captured in your long-term and session memories, so it focuses on narrative flow rather than repeating facts stored elsewhere.

The rolling summary sits alongside canon if you have it enabled - both can be active at the same time, covering different spans of your story's history.

### Scene Detection and History

Smart Memory watches for scene transitions - time skips, location changes, those little `---` dividers between scenes, and intimate partner changes. When one is detected, a short summary of the completed scene is saved. The last few scene summaries are kept in context so the AI always knows where the story has been, not just where it is.

### Story Arcs - Open Threads

Unresolved narrative threads - promises made, character goals, mysteries introduced, tensions left hanging - are tracked and kept in context. When the story resolves one, it gets marked closed and a short narrative summary is generated for the record. This keeps the AI oriented toward where the story is going, not just reacting to the last message.

Story arcs normally start fresh with each new chat. If you are running a continuing story across multiple chats (new chats as chapters rather than fresh starts), you can **pin an arc** with the thumbtack button next to it. Pinned arcs are stored at the character level and appear automatically in every new chat with that character. Unpinning returns it to chat-local scope.

Group chats support pinned arcs too. Pinned arcs in a group are stored against the group itself rather than any individual character, and appear automatically whenever that group starts a new chat.

When a pinned arc gets resolved, it moves to a separate **Resolved Threads** section below the active list rather than being deleted. Resolved arcs are not injected into context but stay visible as a record of where the story has been. A **re-open** button reactivates the thread if the story revisits it; a **remove** button discards it entirely. The resolved state carries into future chats so closed threads arrive already marked as resolved. The Resolved Threads section is collapsed by default and hidden when empty.

### Canon

Once you have at least one resolved arc summary, you can generate a **canon document** - a stable prose narrative synthesized from those arc summaries and high-importance long-term facts. Think of it as a "story bible" for the character: not a list of bullet points, but a composed history written by the model from everything it has learned.

Canon gets its own dedicated slot, separate from the rolling short-term summary. Both can be active at the same time: the summary covers recent events, canon covers the broader history. Canon is stored at the character level and carries forward to new chats with the same character. It is cleared by **Fresh Start** and by the **Clear** button in the Long-term Memory section.

### Character and World Profiles

After each extraction pass, Smart Memory generates compact state snapshots from stored memories and adds them to context alongside the other tiers:

- **Character state** - current emotional state, active goals, relationship posture
- **World state** - active threads in the setting, recent developments, current scene context
- **Relationship matrix** - one-line directional summary per named entity with a confidence score

Profiles are regenerated after each extraction pass and on chat load if stale. On Profile B, an optional message-count schedule can keep them fresh between extraction passes. A manual regenerate button is available in the settings panel.

In group chats, each character has their own independent profile. Switching the character selector updates the profiles panel to show that character's snapshot, and each character's profile is added to context when they are about to respond.

### Relationship History

Alongside individual memories, Smart Memory tracks the current emotional state of every named relationship as a set of descriptors - words like `warm`, `cautious`, `fragile`, `mistrustful`. Each descriptor carries its own magnitude (`low`, `medium`, `high`), displayed as `word(magnitude)` - e.g. `trusting(high), cautious(medium)`. After each extraction pass the model reviews the scene and emits any shifts; new descriptors are merged in and existing ones updated rather than replaced, so the state accumulates across sessions without losing earlier signals. A maximum of six descriptors per pair is kept; the lowest-magnitude entry is dropped when the cap is exceeded.

The **Relationship History** section in the settings panel shows all tracked pairs for the current character. You can add pairs manually (useful for seeding a relationship described in the character card), edit any pair to correct or refine the descriptors, and delete pairs that are no longer relevant. Relationship History is cleared alongside long-term memories when you use **Clear Memories** or **Fresh Start**.

Only pairs whose names appear in the recent message window are injected into context, so the block stays small even for characters with many relationships.

### Perspectives & Secrets

At each scene break, Smart Memory extracts a per-character knowledge map: what each named character knows, suspects, falsely believes, is unaware of, and is actively hiding from someone else. The responding character's knowledge block is then injected privately into their prompt, so the AI can maintain perspective-accurate behaviour - knowing what to reveal, what to deflect, and what they genuinely do not know.

The five tags map to distinct epistemic states:

- **Knows** - facts the character is confident about
- **Suspects** - things they believe but have not confirmed
- **Believes (false)** - things they are sure of that are actually wrong (dramatic irony)
- **Unaware** - things they do not know and have not guessed
- **Hiding** - things they know but are actively concealing from a specific other character

The **Perspectives & Secrets** section in the settings panel shows all extracted entries for the current character. You can add entries manually, edit existing ones, and delete entries that are no longer relevant. The section is collapsed by default on Profile A hardware (local/low-VRAM) where extraction requires a reasoning-capable model - an override toggle in the section enables it when the hardware can handle it.

**Believes** and **Hiding** entries are kept behind a spoiler block at the bottom of the list. It is collapsed by default and requires confirming a warning before it opens, so you do not accidentally reveal secrets that would spoil a mystery scenario. The block is always visible even when empty so you can tell at a glance whether any spoiler-type entries were extracted.

When the entry list grows beyond the injection budget, Smart Memory will ask whether to increase the budget for this roleplay. In normal play the budget grows in 100-token increments per confirmation; after **Memorize Chat** a single dialog sets the exact size needed plus 100 tokens of headroom. The increase applies only to the current chat and does not change the settings slider.

Long-term memories also benefit: memories extracted from a scene the responding character was not present for are labelled `[secondhand]` in their injection, so the AI knows the character learned this through hearsay rather than direct experience. This can be turned off to omit non-witnessed memories entirely.

### Entity Registry

As memories are extracted, Smart Memory tracks the named entities behind them - characters, places, objects, factions, and concepts. The AI classifies each entity by type from the context of the memory it appeared in, so invented names and made-up settings are handled just as well as real-world ones. The registry is built from both your long-term memories and your current session memories, and is updated after each extraction pass.

A collapsible **Entity Registry** panel in the settings shows all tracked entities with:

- Type badge (character / place / object / faction / concept) - click to edit if the classification is wrong
- Number of memories referencing the entity
- Last seen message index
- A **timeline button** that expands a vertical timeline of all memories involving that entity, ordered chronologically, with retired entries shown in muted style
- A **merge button** to combine two entities into one - useful when the model has created separate entries for the same person under different names, or when you want to collapse entries from different tiers together
- A **trash button** to remove an entity entirely, which also cleans up all references to it from stored memories

A **View Graph** button opens a full-screen, force-directed canvas of your character's entire memory network. Entity nodes (larger, coloured by type) are connected to the memories that reference them. Where one memory has replaced another, a directed arrow shows the supersession chain so you can see exactly what was retired and what replaced it. The graph supports pan, zoom, node dragging, click-to-highlight neighbours, and hover tooltips with full memory content. Filters for session memories and retired memories can be toggled on and off without closing the graph. The graph follows your active SillyTavern theme automatically.

### State Ledger

The State Ledger tracks the current observable physical and operational state of named entities as a compact snapshot injected near the active turn. Where long-term memory records permanent facts ("Kael was once a soldier") and session memory records developing details, the State Ledger answers right now questions: where is Kael standing, what is he wearing, what is he carrying, what is the room's current state.

State cards are maintained per entity type:

- **Character** - location, injuries, outfit/disguise, mood, active goal, carried items
- **Object** - owner, location, condition, status
- **Place** - occupants, hazards, political control, damage, accessibility
- **Faction** - leadership, objective, alliances, hostility level

Extraction runs once per session against the current message window. State cards are chat-scoped and do not carry over when a new chat begins. Cards can also be filled in or edited manually from the entity panel - click the edit button below any entity row to open the field editor.

When you merge two entities that both have state cards, a modal asks which card to keep. Deleting an entity with a state card shows a warning before proceeding. Changing an entity's type migrates its state card to the new type automatically.

The section is off by default on Profile A hardware (local/low-VRAM) because weaker models tend to pad unknown fields with placeholder values - an override toggle enables it when the local model is reasoning-capable.

**Tip:** Both Perspectives & Secrets and State Ledger inject close to the active turn by default, which gives stronger models better attention on the content. If your model starts including memory content verbatim in its responses, switch these tiers to **In-Prompt** injection in the Advanced settings - this moves them clearly outside the conversation flow and stops the leaking.

### Away Recap

Come back after a long break and not quite remember where you left off? Smart Memory generates a short "Previously on..." recap and shows it as a dismissible popup before the AI responds. It disappears after the first response - just a gentle reminder, not a permanent fixture.

### Continuity Checker

A manual tool for when something feels off. Click **Check Last Response** (or use `/sm-check`) and Smart Memory asks the AI whether the last response contradicts anything in your established facts. Useful for catching drift in long stories - the AI suddenly forgetting a character detail, reversing a decision that was already made, that kind of thing.

Enable **Auto-repair contradictions** to go one step further: when contradictions are found, Smart Memory generates a brief corrective note and slips it into the next AI response. The note is cleared automatically after that response - it is a one-shot nudge, not a permanent change. This costs one extra model call per check, so it is disabled by default.

When a repair is queued, a toast notification appears so you know it fired. Opening the Continuity section of the settings panel shows the full list of contradictions found and the exact correction text that will be injected. A **Cancel correction** button lets you discard the queued note before it fires if you disagree with it. If you do nothing, the correction goes through automatically on the next response.

On **Profile B** (hosted models), the continuity check runs automatically after every AI response - no button click required. A small badge appears in the settings panel header: **clean** (fades after a few seconds) or **N conflicts** (stays visible until the next check). The **Auto-check after each response** checkbox lets you turn this off while staying on Profile B if you would rather check manually. On Profile A (local hardware) the check is manual-only.

> **Note:** The continuity checker is only as good as the model doing the checking. It checks against your stored memories, the AI character card, and your active user persona - but it is still a sanity check, not a guarantee.

---

## Recommended Setup

Smart Memory is designed to work _alongside_ SillyTavern's built-in vector storage, not replace it. Think of them as complementary layers - vector storage retrieves specific details on demand when they seem relevant, while Smart Memory keeps a curated set of important facts and narrative context always present.

| Layer                         | What it does                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Smart Memory - long-term**  | Always-present character facts from all previous sessions        |
| **Smart Memory - short-term** | Always-present narrative summary of everything before the window |
| **Smart Memory - session**    | Always-present curated details from the current chat             |
| **Vector storage**            | Retrieves specific details on demand when they are relevant      |
| **Message Limit** extension   | Hard cap on raw messages in context - your VRAM budget           |

If you are on limited VRAM (8GB or less), keep the Message Limit extension enabled and consider lowering **Max session memories** to around 15 to keep prompt size comfortable.

### Recommended local models

These models have been tested against Smart Memory's extraction prompts and are listed in order of recommendation - each step down trades quality or precision for a smaller footprint or faster extraction. Reference hardware for testing is an RTX 2080 (8 GB VRAM). Models requiring more VRAM than that are noted as community reports.

[**`gemma4`**](https://ollama.com/library/gemma4) - primary recommendation. Passes all extraction tests cleanly. Produces sharp, precise character facts, well-formed arc descriptions, and accurate session details. Does not over-extract - what it finds is genuinely there. Reference hardware uses `e4b-it-q4_K_M` - this is the minimum tested variant and the floor of what is recommended. Larger variants will perform at least as well. Smaller variants have not been tested and are not recommended. The trade-off is speed: Gemma 4 is a reasoning model and thinks before each extraction pass, so it takes longer per message than Qwen. If output quality matters more than extraction speed, this is the model to use. See [Reasoning models](#reasoning-models) below for setup notes.

[**`Huihui-Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-abliterated`**](https://huggingface.co/huihui-ai/Huihui-Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-abliterated) (6.1 GB) - good balance of quality and speed. Produces accurate character facts and reliably identifies open narrative threads without the reasoning overhead of Gemma 4. Can over-extract on arcs and session memory - tends to file more items than strictly necessary.

[**`mistral:7b`**](https://ollama.com/library/mistral) (4.1 GB) - quality fallback for 6 GB cards or tighter budgets on 8 GB. Extraction quality is lower across all tiers - character details are sometimes less precise, session memory undercounts on shorter exchanges, and arc descriptions tend to be vaguer. Still functional and worth using if the 2 GB saving over Qwen matters to you.

[**`gemma3:4b`**](https://ollama.com/library/gemma3) (3.3 GB) - minimum viable option. The quality gap is meaningful: on shorter exchanges it can misread character traits, occasionally produces duplicate entries in a single pass, and is more prone to extracting from prompt examples rather than conversation content on complex prompts. Use it only if 4 GB is a hard limit and you accept that memory quality will be noticeably lower than the models above.

Smart Memory's prompts are longer than typical chat prompts - a model that works fine for roleplay may still struggle with extraction if the combined prompt length exceeds its effective context window. If you get empty or garbled extraction output with a different model, context overflow is the most likely cause. Use the **Test Extraction Model** button to check any model before committing to it.

### Reasoning models

Reasoning models (models that produce a thinking block before their actual response) are supported. Smart Memory automatically gives these models unlimited generation room so they can finish thinking before producing extraction output, then strips the reasoning block before parsing.

Reasoning block stripping uses SillyTavern's own reasoning template system, so any model that ST already recognises will work out of the box. To check or configure this:

1. In SillyTavern, open **User Settings** → **Advanced Formatting** → **Reasoning**
2. Select the template that matches your model, or set a custom prefix and suffix if your model is not listed

If no template is configured, or the template does not match what your model outputs, the reasoning block will pass through to the parsers. The tagged-line parsers (long-term, session, arcs) will silently discard it since they only match `[type]` tagged lines - but parsers that produce free-form output (profiles, relationship history, continuity) may be affected. Setting the correct template in ST is recommended for any reasoning model.

Gemma 4 is the exception among reasoning models - most reasoning models are not good choices for extraction. DeepSeek R1 and similar models tend to run extended thinking blocks, consume their generation budget before producing output, and then produce garbled or incorrect structured data. Gemma 4 performs well above what its size would suggest and handles the structured extraction format cleanly. Do not assume another reasoning model will behave the same way - use the model test to verify before committing to one.

The trade-off specific to Gemma 4 is speed: the thinking block adds time before each extraction pass. If extraction latency is a concern, a non-reasoning model like Qwen3 will be faster. Either way, make sure thinking is not disabled at the model level - some reasoning models produce poor output without their reasoning enabled.

### Testing your model

The **Test Extraction Model** button (in the **Configuration** section, below the hardware profile) runs the extraction pipeline against three fixed roleplay scenarios and shows you the model's raw output for each tier. All five tiers always run regardless of which are enabled in your settings - you can evaluate the full pipeline before committing to a configuration.

The test is safe to run mid-roleplay - it uses its own private scenarios and never writes anything to your session, chat history, or stored memories.

**What the test does:**

- Runs long-term memories, session memories, and story arcs through a 30-message fantasy investigation scenario
- Runs Perspectives & Secrets through a separate village healer scenario designed to exercise all five epistemic tag types
- Runs State Ledger through a separate dungeon heist scenario with a small set of known entities
- Displays results one tier at a time with **Previous** and **Next** buttons to step through them
- Each tier shows the model's raw output in a text area alongside a hint describing what a capable model should produce
- If any tier returns empty output the test stops immediately and reports which tier failed

**What to look for:**

**Long-term memories, session memories, story arcs** (investigation scenario - multiple named characters, key revelations, explicit promises, and open threads):

- **Long-term memories**: 5 or more items covering character facts, relationships, and significant events
- **Session memories**: 4 or more items covering scene details, revelations, and developments
- **Story arcs**: 3-4 items identifying unresolved threads - not events that already happened

**Perspectives & Secrets** (village healer scenario - four characters, secondhand knowledge, a hidden secret):

- Should produce entries across most or all five tag types: `[knows]`, `[suspects]`, `[believes]`, `[unaware]`, `[hiding]`
- A model that confuses `[knows]` with `[hiding]`, or misses all entries of a tag type entirely, may not be suitable for this tier

**State Ledger** (dungeon heist scenario - small cast with observable physical state):

- Should extract current physical state for the named entities that have observable state
- Characters mentioned but with no observable state should produce no entry
- Any field value of "unknown", "none", or a placeholder means the model is padding rather than omitting unknowns - unsuitable for state extraction

You are the judge. The hint on each tier tells you what to expect; the raw output tells you what the model actually did. Look for structured tagged lines (`[fact]`, `[scene]`, `[arc]`, etc.) with meaningful content. Vague items or repeated paraphrases of the same fact are signs of a weaker model; completely empty output means the model is not suitable.

## Manual Operations

Already have chats that predate Smart Memory? **Memorize Chat** reads through an existing chat and builds the full set of memories, scene history, arcs, and summary from it. Run it on any older chat to bring that character's history into the system.

### Memorize Chat

Reads the full chat history and builds memories from it - long-term facts, session details, scene history, story arcs, summary, and profiles. Use this to bring Smart Memory up to speed on an existing chat, or to build up a character's long-term memories from older sessions.

In group chats, Memorize Chat processes all active group members - not just the one currently selected. Each character gets their own pass through the messages, their own memories, and their own profiles at the end.

A **Cancel** button appears during processing. Cancelling stops cleanly between chunks - anything processed so far is saved.

If memories already exist for one or more characters, a confirmation prompt appears before processing begins. Running Memorize Chat repeatedly on the same chat can introduce near-duplicate entries. Use **Forget This Chat** first if you want a clean re-run.

Only accepted messages are processed - swiped alternatives are ignored.

To build long-term memories from multiple older chats, open each one and run Memorize Chat. Memories accumulate and deduplicate automatically. Skip any chats you would rather not include.

### Forget This Chat

Clears all chat-scoped context - summary, session memories, scene history, story arcs, profiles, and the session entity list. The following are not cleared and carry forward unchanged: long-term memories, relationship history, state cards, canon, pinned arcs, and the persistent entity registry. Useful before a Memorize Chat run to re-derive everything cleanly from scratch.

### Fresh Start

Clears everything for a clean slate - long-term memories, canon, and entity registry for the current character, plus all chat-scoped tiers (summary, session memories, scene history, arcs, profiles). The AI will begin building fresh memories from the next message onward. Asks for confirmation before proceeding - this cannot be undone.

To prevent a specific chat from contributing to long-term memory at all, use **Read-only mode** instead.

### Read-only Mode

The **Read-only mode - protect character memories** toggle sits just below the chat action buttons. When it is on, the character arrives with all their memories and behaves completely normally - but nothing from this chat gets written back to their permanent history. No new long-term memories, no new arcs, no canon or profile updates.

Use it to safely explore a risky scene before deciding whether to commit it to the character's history. Or for a completely consequence-free session where nothing changes permanently. When you turn it off, their memories are exactly as you left them before the session.

When you turn read-only off, a dialog asks what to do with the session:

- **Commit** - keeps everything. Session memories are preserved and Smart Memory runs full extraction on the window - long-term memories, arcs, and profiles are built as if read-only had never been active. The messages stay visible.
- **Discard** - throws everything away. Session memories are purged and the messages from the read-only window are hidden from the AI so they can never influence future extraction passes.

You can toggle read-only on and off multiple times in the same chat; each window is handled independently.

**Using read-only with checkpoints and branches:** SillyTavern's checkpoint and branch features save the chat up to a specific point as a new file. Smart Memory's long-term memories are shared across all chats with the same character - they do not roll back if you switch to an older checkpoint or branch. If you plan to explore alternative story paths this way, enable read-only mode first. Smart Memory will warn you with a notification if you create a checkpoint or branch without it active.

### Per-tier Extract Buttons

Each memory tier has its own **Extract Now** or **Extract** button that processes a recent window of messages - not the full chat. Useful for pulling in the latest exchanges outside the automatic schedule.

| Button                | Window                           |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Long-term Extract Now | Last 20 messages                 |
| Session Extract Now   | Last 40 messages                 |
| Extract Arcs Now      | Last 100 messages                |
| Extract Scene         | Scene buffer or last 40 messages |

For the full chat backlog, use **Memorize Chat** instead.

### Other Per-tier Buttons

- **Summarize Now** - forces a short-term summary right now, ignoring the threshold
- **Generate Canon** - synthesizes a prose narrative from resolved arc summaries and high-importance facts. Requires at least one resolved arc summary. On Profile B this runs automatically after each arc closes. Canon is stored at the character level and survives across chats - cleared by Fresh Start and the Long-term Memory Clear button. The canon textarea is also editable directly
- **Generate Recap Now** - generates and shows a recap popup on demand
- **Check Last Response** - runs the continuity check against the last AI response
- **Regenerate Profiles Now** - regenerates character and world profiles immediately
- **Clear** buttons on each tier - remove all stored data for that tier

### Editing and Adding Memories Manually

Every entry in the long-term memory, session memory, and story arc lists has action buttons:

- **Pencil (edit)** - replaces the entry with an inline text editor. Edit the content and click **Save**, or **Cancel** to discard changes. Not shown on retired memories.
- **Trash** - removes the entry immediately without generating a summary. For story arcs this permanently discards the thread.
- **Checkmark (story arcs only)** - resolves the arc: generates an arc summary, moves it to the Resolved Threads panel, and on Profile B triggers automatic canon regeneration. Use this when a thread has genuinely concluded in the story. The summary is built from recent scene context, so it works best when clicked shortly after the thread resolves in the roleplay - resolving old threads retroactively may produce vague summaries. Use the trash button instead if you just want to remove an arc without summarising it.
- **Pin (active story arcs only)** - marks the arc as persistent so it carries into future chats. The pin icon turns gold and the arc gets a gold left border when pinned. Click again to unpin. In group chats, the pin stores the arc against the group rather than an individual character.
- **Re-open (resolved arcs only)** - moves the arc back to the active list. If an equivalent thread is already active the resolved copy is discarded instead.
- **Remove (resolved arcs only)** - discards the resolved arc from the panel and the persistent store.
- **Jump to source** - scrolls the chat to the message window the memory was extracted from. Shown on session memories whenever provenance is available, and on long-term memories when the memory was extracted from the current chat.

Below each list an **Add** form lets you insert a new entry manually:

- For long-term and session memories, a color-coded type picker lets you choose the type before adding. Each type is shown in its badge color so you can see what you are picking.
- For story arcs, just type the thread and click **Add**.

Manual edits take effect immediately and are added to the prompt on the next message.

## Settings

All settings are saved automatically. Hardware Profile, Memory LLM, and Memory Deduplication are in the **Configuration** accordion at the bottom of the extension panel.

### Simple and Advanced Mode

The settings panel has two modes so you can keep things simple or go deep:

- **Simple mode** (default) - shows only the most commonly adjusted settings: hardware profile, extraction frequency (Low/Medium/High), and how much context Smart Memory is allowed to use. Everything else runs on sensible defaults.
- **Advanced mode** - reveals the full set of controls: per-tier context budgets, where each tier appears in the prompt, how deep, what role, the template text, summarization thresholds, response length budgets, and the Consolidation section. Toggle it with the **Advanced mode** checkbox at the top of the settings panel.

Switching from simple to advanced never overwrites your values - the advanced controls always show the current state.

| Setting           | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto-tune budgets | Off     | Automatically adjusts per-tier injection budgets based on observed demand. Each tier's budget is set to its actual usage plus 15% headroom. Budgets never drop below their defaults. In group chats, budgets are sized for the most memory-heavy character seen this session |

### Hardware Profile

Smart Memory adjusts its behavior based on whether you are using a local model or a hosted service. The profile is auto-detected from your Memory LLM selection but can be overridden manually.

| Setting          | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hardware profile | Auto    | Auto-detects from your memory source. Ollama or WebLLM selects Profile A (fewer model calls, lighter extraction). Main API, OpenAI Compatible, or ST Connection Profile selects Profile B (richer extraction, automatic continuity checks, auto-canon). Override manually if auto-detection does not match your setup |

**Profile A** (local hardware - Ollama, WebLLM) is designed to be conservative with model calls. Extraction runs on a schedule, scene AI detection is off by default, the continuity check is manual-only, and canon generation is triggered manually. This keeps things running smoothly on limited VRAM.

**Profile B** (hosted models - Main API, OpenAI Compatible) takes advantage of faster, less constrained inference. The continuity check runs automatically after every response, canon regenerates automatically when an arc closes, and profile regeneration can be scheduled on a message-count interval in addition to extraction passes.

### Memory LLM

Selects which AI model handles all Smart Memory work - summarization, extraction, and recap generation. Setting this to a lighter model leaves your main roleplay model free for the actual story.

Options: **Main API**, **Ollama**, **OpenAI Compatible**, **WebLLM Extension**, or **ST Connection Profile**.

**ST Connection Profile** lets you pick any saved SillyTavern connection profile to use for memory work. The profile's server URL, model, and API credentials are used automatically - no re-entry needed. This is the easiest option if you already have your extraction model saved as an ST profile. Select the source, then choose a profile from the dropdown that appears. Only Chat Completion and Text Completion profile types are supported.

> **URL format:** Enter only the base URL - do not include `/v1` at the end. The extension appends the full path automatically. For example, NovelAI should be entered as `https://text.novelai.net/oa`, not `https://text.novelai.net/oa/v1`.
>
> **Cloud providers and CORS:** Remote/cloud APIs (such as Nvidia NIM, OpenRouter, or OpenAI) are automatically routed through SillyTavern's server-side proxy, which avoids the CORS restrictions those services impose on browser connections. Local servers (localhost and private network addresses) are contacted directly as before - no proxy or extra setup needed for either case.
>
> **Free tier rate limits:** Free tier accounts on cloud providers typically allow only a few requests per minute. Smart Memory makes several sequential requests during catch-up and other multi-pass operations, which can exceed these limits and cause errors partway through. A paid tier or a provider with generous rate limits is recommended for regular use.
>
> **Privacy:** Chat history is included in extraction prompts and sent to the configured API. Users with sensitive or adult content should use a local model (Ollama) to keep all data on their own machine.

**Advanced:** A **Generation budget** slider is available in advanced mode. It sets the maximum tokens the Memory LLM may generate per extraction call. The default of 8192 is generous enough for any thinking model under normal conditions. Raise it only if extractions are consistently aborting before producing output on a very verbose thinking model. An **Unlimited (-1)** checkbox is also available - use it with caution on local hardware, as a runaway generation will lock up Ollama until it is manually stopped.

### Memory Deduplication

Smart Memory uses a small helper model to understand whether two memories are saying the same thing, even if the wording is completely different. For example, "Finn is Senjin's anchor" and "Finn serves as Senjin's emotional foundation" look nothing alike as text, but the helper model recognises them as the same fact and prevents the duplicate from being stored. The same helper model is also used to measure how relevant each stored memory is to the current moment in the story, which affects which memories get prioritised in context.

This helper model is tiny and runs on CPU - it does not compete with your main roleplay model for VRAM or slow anything down.

If you do not have an embedding model set up, Smart Memory falls back to keyword matching automatically. It works, but catches fewer paraphrased duplicates.

| Setting                 | Default                         | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use semantic embeddings | On                              | Use the helper model to compare memories by meaning rather than by shared words                                           |
| Embedding source        | Ollama                          | Which server provides embeddings: Ollama or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint                                                |
| Embedding URL           | _(blank, uses localhost:11434)_ | Base URL of your embedding server - only change if it is on a different port or host                                      |
| Embedding model         | `nomic-embed-text`              | The model used for meaning comparison                                                                                     |
| Keep model in memory    | Off                             | (Ollama only) Keeps the helper model loaded between calls - faster if Smart Memory runs frequently                        |

**Ollama:** The embedding model must be installed before enabling this. If you already use SillyTavern's built-in Vector Storage extension with Ollama, you likely have `nomic-embed-text` installed already. If not:

```sh
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

**OpenAI Compatible:** Set the embedding source to "OpenAI Compatible", enter the base URL of your server, and type the model name it exposes for embeddings. Works with any server that implements the `/v1/embeddings` endpoint. If your server requires an API key, enter it in the API key field - it is stored in extension settings alongside other Smart Memory configuration.

The long-term list shows a **retired** badge on superseded entries. A "Show retired memories" toggle reveals them. Each retired entry has a "superseded by" link to the replacement. Memories with unresolved contradictions show a yellow warning indicator.

### Session Memory

| Setting                  | Default                                   | Description                                                                 |

### Scene Detection

### Consolidation

Over time, the same information can accumulate in slightly different forms across multiple extraction passes. Consolidation runs quietly in the background after each extraction and asks the AI to merge near-identical or redundant entries into richer single items. You end up with fewer, better memories rather than a growing list of overlapping notes.

The Consolidation section is only visible in advanced mode. In simple mode it always runs on the defaults below.

| Setting                               | Default | Description                                                                                |

### Canon

| Setting            | Default                         | Description                                                                        |

| Injection budget   | 800 tokens                      | Canon text is trimmed from the end if it would exceed this limit                   |
| Injection template | `Character history:\n{{canon}}` | The wrapper text around the canon document                                         |
| Injection position | After Main Prompt               | Where in the prompt canon appears                                                  |

The **Generate Canon** button synthesizes a prose narrative from resolved arc summaries and high-importance long-term facts, stores it at the character level, and immediately adds it to context. At least one resolved arc summary is required. On Profile B this regenerates automatically after each arc closes. Canon is stored at the character level and survives across chats - it is cleared by Fresh Start and the Long-term Memory Clear button. The canon textarea in the Canon section is also editable directly if you want to adjust it by hand.

### Character and World Profiles

| Injection token budget | 400               | Trim profiles if they would exceed this many tokens                                                       |
| Injection position     | After Main Prompt | Where in the prompt profiles appear                                                                       |

A live token count shows how much context the current profiles are using. A **Regenerate Profiles Now** button forces immediate regeneration. The current profiles are shown read-only below the controls.

## Memory Types

**Long-term** memories are tagged by type:

- `fact` - established truths about the character, world, or setting
- `relationship` - the current state and history of the relationship
- `preference` - what the user demonstrably enjoys (themes, tone, pacing)
- `event` - significant events that should be recalled in future sessions

**Session** memories are tagged by type:

- `scene` - current or recently completed scene details
- `revelation` - something discovered or revealed this session
- `development` - how the relationship or situation changed
- `detail` - specific facts, names, objects, or places mentioned

Extraction also assigns:

- **Importance (1-3)** - how impactful the memory is (`1` fluff, `2` context, `3` core)
- **Expiration** - expected durability:
  - `scene` (short-lived)
  - `session` (current chat scope)
  - `permanent` (durable, keep aggressively)

When the memory budget is full and something needs to be trimmed, Smart Memory keeps the entries that matter most and quietly drops the ones that have become less relevant over time. See [Memory Prioritisation](#memory-prioritisation) in the Advanced section for details on how this works.

### Supersession

When the story changes a fact - a character moves, a relationship ends, a decision is reversed - Smart Memory detects this and retires the old memory automatically rather than leaving two contradictory versions sitting side by side. The old memory is kept in storage (visible with the "Show retired memories" toggle) but is no longer added to the AI's context.

See [How Supersession Works](#how-supersession-works) in the Advanced section if you are curious about the detection mechanism.

### Contradiction Warnings

When two stored memories cannot both be true and neither clearly replaces the other, they are flagged with a yellow warning indicator. Use **Check Last Response** to surface and optionally repair these conflicts.

## Advanced

This section covers the technical details behind Smart Memory's behaviour. You do not need to read it to use the extension - everything works out of the box. It is here for curious users and for anyone tuning Smart Memory alongside other extensions.

### Injection Depth Stacking Order

Smart Memory's defaults are designed to layer cleanly alongside SillyTavern's Vector Storage extension. "Depth" is how far a piece of context sits from the AI's response - depth 0 is right before the AI responds, higher numbers sit further back.

| Tier                   | Position          | Notes                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| State Ledger           | In-chat @ depth 1 | Current entity state, alongside Perspectives    |
| Perspectives & Secrets | In-chat @ depth 1 | Per-character knowledge block, closest to reply |
| Arcs                   | In-chat @ depth 2 | Shares depth with ST chat vectors intentionally |
| Session                | In-chat @ depth 3 | Just above ST's default vector depth            |
| Scenes                 | In-chat @ depth 6 | Further back - past scene context               |
| Long-term              | After Main Prompt | Near character card                             |
| Short-term             | After Main Prompt | Rolling narrative summary                       |
| Canon                  | After Main Prompt | Stable character history, separate slot         |
| Profiles               | After Main Prompt | State snapshots, near character card            |

The away recap is shown as a popup to the user, not added to the prompt.

If you change ST's vector storage depth, set session memory one higher so it still layers above vectors.

### Memory Prioritisation

When memories would exceed the token budget, Smart Memory scores each entry across several dimensions and trims the lowest-scoring ones first: how permanent the memory is, how important it was rated at extraction time, how recently it was recalled, how many times it has been used, and how confident the system is that it is still true. Relationship and fact entries for long-term memory, and development and scene entries for session memory, are held onto more aggressively since these tend to matter most for story continuity.

### How Supersession Works

Supersession detection runs in two passes. First, a quick pattern check looks for state-change language in the new memory - phrases like "no longer", "became", "healed", "left the", "was captured", and many others cover the most common ways a fact changes in natural language. Second, when two memories score as clearly being about the same topic but no pattern phrase was found (because the phrasing was unusual - "confiscated", "hijacked", etc.), Smart Memory asks the AI directly: does this new memory update or replace the old one, or are both still true at the same time? One short question, one word answer. Extra model calls only happen when a suspicious pair is found - quiet passes cost nothing extra.

### Macro Injection

Each memory tier exposes a macro token you can place anywhere in a character card field or instruct template. When Smart Memory finds its token in a card, it injects the tier's content at that position instead of using its default injection slot - so you control exactly where each tier appears relative to your own scaffolding.

| Macro                           | Tier                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `{{smartmemory-shortterm}}`     | Short-term summary        |
| `{{smartmemory-longterm}}`      | Long-term memories        |
| `{{smartmemory-triggered}}`     | Contextually triggered memories (keyword-matched subset of long-term, re-injected closer to the prompt) |
| `{{smartmemory-session}}`       | Session memories          |
| `{{smartmemory-scenes}}`        | Scene history             |
| `{{smartmemory-arcs}}`          | Story arcs                |
| `{{smartmemory-relationships}}` | Relationship history      |
| `{{smartmemory-canon}}`         | Canon                     |
| `{{smartmemory-profiles}}`      | Profiles                  |
| `{{smartmemory-epistemic}}`     | Perspectives & Secrets    |
| `{{smartmemory-stateledger}}`   | State Ledger              |
| `{{smartmemory-unified}}`       | Unified block (see below) |

Place any token in the **Main Prompt**, **Description**, **Personality summary**, **Scenario**, or **Examples of dialogue** fields of a character card. Smart Memory detects the token automatically and activates macro mode for that tier - no settings change needed.

If you place macros in an **instruct template** rather than a character card, enable **Force macro injection mode** in Configuration (advanced mode). Instruct templates cannot be scanned for auto-detection, so the override is required.

The `{{smartmemory-unified}}` macro is only active when **Unified injection** is also on. It lets you control where the merged block lands in the same way individual tier macros control per-tier placement. Individual tier macros are inactive while unified injection is on - unified owns all tier content.

### Developer Settings

| Setting             | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Verbose logging     | Off     | Print detailed progress to the browser console for extraction, consolidation, and scene detection. Errors are always logged regardless                                                                           |
| Injection refresh period | 1 | Minimum AI messages between long-term and session slot updates. 1 = refresh every message (default). Raise this if you are on a cloud API and want to preserve prompt cache hits between extraction passes - recent events are still visible in chat history during the gap. Note: character and world profiles re-inject every extraction pass regardless of this setting, so enabling profiles alongside a high refresh period will still invalidate the top of the prompt on each pass. Available in advanced mode |
| Unified injection   | Off     | Merges all memory tiers into a single block ordered from most stable (canon, long-term) to most immediate (session, arcs). Disables per-tier depth and position settings while active. Available in advanced mode |
| Force macro injection mode | Off | Forces macro injection for all tiers. Use when macros are in instruct templates (cannot be auto-detected from card fields). When unified injection is on, activates `{{smartmemory-unified}}` for instruct templates - individual tier macros remain inactive. Leave off for card macros - auto-detection handles them |

## Known Limitations

**Editing past messages** - If a message is edited after Smart Memory has already extracted memories from it, those memories are not updated. The character may hold beliefs formed from the original text that no longer match the edited version. If you edit a message and the change is significant, review the relevant memory entries manually and correct or delete them as needed.

**Hiding past messages** - Hiding a message that Smart Memory has already processed does not remove the memories formed from it. The information stays in the character's memory even though the message is no longer in context.

**Checkpoints and branches** - See the [Read-only Mode](#read-only-mode) section.
