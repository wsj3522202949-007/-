# Word Wise – Smart Grammar & Writing Assistant

--- 

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Why
WordWise was created to **improve writing clarity, correctness, and confidence** in real time.  
It addresses the common issues faced by students and professionals such as grammatical errors, poor sentence flow, and lack of writing insights — while maintaining **privacy-first and lightweight design principles**.

### 1.2 What
A **web-based smart grammar & writing assistant** that provides:

- Real-time grammar, spelling, and punctuation correction  
- Context-aware writing suggestions  
- Visual writing analytics and insights  
- Interactive brainstorming via a drawing board  
- Offline engagement through a built-in mini-game  

### 1.3 How (High-Level)
- User text is analyzed live through a grammar-checking API  
- Suggestions are rendered instantly on the frontend  
- Writing metrics are visualized using interactive charts  
- Backend enforces rate limiting and stability  
- Offline states activate an interactive game to retain engagement

---

## 6. Major Components

### 6.1 Grammar Engine

* Processes text in real time
* Detects grammar, spelling, and punctuation issues
* Returns contextual suggestions

## 7. Data Handling & Privacy

* User-written text is **not permanently stored**
* Grammar checks are processed ephemerally
* No authentication or personal identifiers required
* Designed with privacy-first principles

---

## 8. System Workflow

1. **User Inputs Text** – Typed directly into the editor
2. **Grammar Analysis** – Backend processes text
3. **Suggestions Returned** – Highlighted in real time
4. **Analytics Updated** – Charts reflect writing metrics
5. **Offline Mode** – Mini-game activates if server is unavailable

---

## 9. API & Stability

* Rate limiting enforced via **Flask-Limiter**
* CORS configured for frontend-backend communication
* Serverless-compatible request handling

---

## 10. Limitations

* Single-user workflow (no accounts)
* Dependency on external grammar API
* No persistent history tracking yet
* Web-only interface (no mobile app)

---

## 11. Usage Example

```text
User types paragraph →
Errors highlighted →
Suggestions shown →
Analytics update in dashboard
```

During downtime:

```text
Server offline →
Word Catcher game activates
```

---

## 12. Future Improvements

* User authentication and personal history
* PDF / DOCX export support
* Offline grammar engine
* Voice-to-text integration
* AI-powered vocabulary enhancement
