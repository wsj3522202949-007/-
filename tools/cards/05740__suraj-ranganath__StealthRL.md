## Abstract

AI-text detectors are increasingly used in high-stakes settings, yet their robustness to meaning-preserving adversarial rewriting remains uncertain. We introduce StealthRL, a reinforcement learning framework for stress-testing AI-text detectors with adaptive paraphrase attacks. StealthRL trains a paraphrase policy against a detector ensemble while preserving semantic content, then evaluates transfer to held-out detector families. On the full filtered MAGE test pool (15,310 human / 14,656 AI), StealthRL reduces mean AUROC from 0.79 to 0.43 and achieves a 0.024 mean TPR@1%FPR across RoBERTa, Fast-DetectGPT, Binoculars, and MAGE. The attack transfers to two detectors not used during training, exposing shared vulnerabilities rather than a single-detector failure. We further analyze detector score distributions and evaluate quality with E5, BERTScore, and LLM-based Likert ratings. Our results show that current AI-text detectors remain brittle under realistic paraphrasing pressure and provide a reproducible protocol for adversarial robustness evaluation.

## What This Repository Contains

This repository is the research and engineering codebase behind StealthRL. It contains:

- GRPO-based training code for the StealthRL paraphrase policy
- attack-method implementations for the paper methods M0-M5
- detector wrappers and evaluation utilities
- the staged full-MAGE evaluation pipeline used to produce the reported results
- plotting, metrics, and quality-judging code for paper-ready figures and tables

The repo is intended to be a useful starting point for researchers who want to:

- reproduce our detector-robustness evaluation
- swap in new detectors or attack methods
- study transfer to held-out detector families
- benchmark their own paraphrasing defenses or red-team methods

## Repository Map

- `stealthrl/`: training code, detector wrappers, rewards, data utilities, and the original StealthBench package
- `eval/`: research-grade evaluation harness used for the paper results
- `scripts/`: runnable entry points for training, evaluation, orchestration, plotting, and utilities
- `configs/`: YAML configs for training, evaluation, and ablations
- `figures/`: pipeline diagrams and static assets
- `tests/`: integration and sanity checks
- `analysis/`: ad hoc analysis helpers and one-off utilities

## Environment Setup

### Base environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Optional dependencies

Depending on which parts of the project you want to run, you may also need:

```bash
pip install tinker
pip install openai
pip install vllm
```

Notes:

- `tinker` is required for the cloud-backed StealthRL checkpoint inference path used by `M2`.
- `openai` is only required for the GPT/Likert quality evaluation step.
- `vllm` is recommended for fast local generation in the paper baselines.

### Environment variables

Typical environment variables used by the repo:

```bash
export HF_HOME=$HOME/.cache/huggingface
export TRANSFORMERS_CACHE=$HF_HOME
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export TINKER_API_KEY=...
```

For the staged paper evaluation pipeline, we used an env file plus a checkpoint descriptor JSON. The public scripts let you override both paths explicitly:

```bash
python scripts/run_full_mage_research_eval.py \
  --env-file ~/.config/stealthrl/eval.env \
  --checkpoint-json ~/.config/stealthrl/m2_checkpoint.json
```

## Quick Start

### Quick evaluation smoke test

```bash
python scripts/run_eval.py --quick
```

### Run the legacy StealthBench harness

```bash
python scripts/run_stealthbench.py --config configs/stealthbench.yaml
```

This now loads the configured text files, runs the configured detectors, saves CSV outputs, and generates comparison plots. The old TODO-only stub has been removed.

### Run a staged full MAGE evaluation

```bash
python scripts/run_full_mage_research_eval.py \
  --env-file ~/.config/stealthrl/eval.env \
  --checkpoint-json ~/.config/stealthrl/m2_checkpoint.json \
  --run-root outputs/eval_runs/full_mage_public \
  --gpus 0 1 2 3
```

### Run the demo website

The repository includes a FastAPI-backed demo website under `demo/`. It serves a polished static UI and exposes `POST /api/paraphrase` with API-key support plus a 20/day public quota for unauthenticated users.

```bash
pip install -r demo/requirements.txt
uvicorn demo.stealthrl_demo.app:app --reload --port 8080
```

By default the demo runs in zero-cost `mock` mode for UI testing. To use the real StealthRL sampler, set `STEALTHRL_DEMO_INFERENCE_BACKEND=tinker`, `STEALTHRL_DEMO_CHECKPOINT_JSON`, and `TINKER_API_KEY`. See `demo/README.md` for API-key, quota, Docker, and AWS deployment notes.

## Reproducing the Paper Results

The paper reports results on the full filtered MAGE evaluation pool:

- 15,310 human samples
- 14,656 AI samples
- 29,966 total

The research-grade evaluation pipeline is implemented in the `eval/` module plus the staged scripts under `scripts/`.

### Recommended reproduction flow

1. Prepare credentials and checkpoint metadata.

   Create an env file containing `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `TINKER_API_KEY`, and a checkpoint JSON describing the StealthRL Tinker sampler path.

2. Run preflight.

```bash
python scripts/preflight_research_eval.py \
  --env-file ~/.config/stealthrl/eval.env \
  --checkpoint-json ~/.config/stealthrl/m2_checkpoint.json
```

3. Launch the full evaluation.

```bash
python scripts/run_full_mage_research_eval.py \
  --env-file ~/.config/stealthrl/eval.env \
  --checkpoint-json ~/.config/stealthrl/m2_checkpoint.json \
  --run-root outputs/eval_runs/full_mage_repro \
  --gpus 0 1 2 3
```

4. Inspect generated method outputs, detector scores, metrics, and plots under the chosen run directory.

5. If you only need to rerun GPT-based quality judging on cached outputs:

```bash
python scripts/run_gpt_quality_only.py \
  --run-root outputs/eval_runs/full_mage_repro \
  --env-file ~/.config/stealthrl/eval.env
```

6. If you only need to add BERTScore to an assembled run with cached outputs:

```bash
python scripts/compute_bertscore_for_run.py \
  --run-dir outputs/eval_runs/full_mage_repro/assembled \
  --device cuda:0 \
  --batch-size 16 \
  --chunk-size 512
```

The BERTScore script updates `quality.parquet` and `quality.csv` in place after every chunk, so interrupted runs can be resumed without recomputing completed rows. Use `--limit-per-method` for a small smoke test and `--force` only when intentionally recomputing existing BERTScore columns.

### Main output artifacts

The staged run produces:

- `method_runs/`: per-method generated outputs
- `detector_scores/`: per-detector parquet score files
- `assembled/metrics.json`: aggregate detector metrics
- `assembled/thresholds.json`: calibrated detector thresholds
- `assembled/quality.parquet`: automatic quality metrics
- `assembled/quality_gpt.parquet`: GPT/Likert quality ratings
- `assembled/figures/`: paper-ready plots

### Canonical paper settings

The primary paper checkpoint uses `configs/tinker_mage_10k.yaml` as the canonical training configuration: Qwen3-4B-Instruct with LoRA rank 32, GRPO group size 8, 10,000 MAGE training samples, three epochs, learning rate `2.8e-4`, KL coefficient `0.05`, temperature `1.0`, top-p `0.9`, and a two-detector reward ensemble weighted `0.6` RoBERTa / `0.4` Fast-DetectGPT. Other configs in `configs/` are retained as legacy examples, smoke-test settings, or ablation templates and should not be treated as paper-authoritative unless explicitly documented.

## Training Implementation

StealthRL trains a paraphrase policy rather than a detector. The core idea is to optimize a model that rewrites AI-generated text so that it remains semantically faithful while reducing detector confidence.

### Model and optimization

- Base model: `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507`
- Adaptation: LoRA
- RL algorithm: GRPO
- Training style: detector-guided paraphrase policy optimization

### Reward design

The reward is multi-objective and balances:

- detector evasion against the in-training detector ensemble
- semantic preservation relative to the source text
- generation validity and stability constraints

The implementation lives primarily in:

- `stealthrl/tinker/train.py`
- `stealthrl/rewards/`
- `configs/`

### Inference-time behavior

The paper’s StealthRL attack is single-shot at test time:

- one policy generation call per sample
- no iterative refinement loop
- no target-detector queries during evaluation

Detector access is used during offline RL training and for external evaluation, not for adaptive query-time search in `M2`.

## Evaluation Implementation

The paper evaluation is implemented in the newer `eval/` stack rather than the older `stealthrl/evaluation/` harness.

### Methods

- `M0`: no attack
- `M1`: simple paraphrase baseline
- `M2`: StealthRL
- `M3`: detector-guided adversarial paraphrasing baseline
- `M4`: AuthorMist baseline
- `M5`: character-level obfuscation baseline

Relevant code:

- `eval/methods/`
- `scripts/generate_method_outputs.py`

### Detector panel

The main paper detector panel uses:

- `roberta`: `openai-community/roberta-large-openai-detector`
- `fast_detectgpt`
- `binoculars`
- `mage`: `yaful/MAGE`

The repo also retains `ghostbuster` support for legacy/compatibility experiments, but Ghostbuster is not part of the final four-detector paper panel.

Relevant code:

- `eval/detectors.py`
- `scripts/score_detector_outputs.py`
- `eval/runner.py`

### Metrics and quality analysis

The public evaluation code computes:

- AUROC
- TPR@1%FPR
- TPR@5%FPR
- ASR
- E5 similarity
- BERTScore precision/recall/F1
- perplexity
- edit rate
- GPT/Likert quality and similarity scores
- bootstrap confidence intervals

Relevant code:

- `eval/metrics.py`
- `eval/plots.py`
- `eval/quality_judge.py`
- `scripts/finalize_eval_run.py`

## Engineering Notes

### vLLM integration

The current evaluation code supports vLLM-backed local generation for high-throughput baseline evaluation. This is implemented in:

- `eval/methods/vllm_backend.py`

### Tinker integration

The StealthRL `M2` method supports Tinker-backed sampling via a checkpoint descriptor JSON. This path is implemented in:

- `eval/methods/stealthrl.py`

### Resume and staged orchestration

The full-MAGE pipeline is intentionally staged:

- preflight checks fail fast on detector/model setup problems
- per-method generation is isolated and resumable
- detector scoring is separated from generation
- final assembly and GPT judging are resumable

This makes long multi-GPU runs more robust and easier to debug.
