---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create Your First Project

```bash
npx @doplan-dev/cli
```

This launches an interactive wizard that will:
1. Ask for your project name
2. Let you choose your preferred IDE
3. Generate a complete project structure

### 2. Open Your Project

```bash
cd your-project-name
code .  # or your preferred IDE
```

### 3. Start Building

Once in your IDE, start using DoPlan commands:

```bash
/hey       # Welcome, tutorial, and command introductions
/do        # Capture project idea, conduct meeting, and refine
/plan      # Generate execution plan + task hierarchy
/dev       # Start development workflow for a feature
/done      # Mark current task complete and auto-commit/push
/sys       # System control panel (engagement, performance, backup, etc.)
```

## 📖 How to Use

### Core Commands

DoPlan uses intuitive slash commands that work directly in your AI-powered IDE:

#### Project Planning Commands

- **`/hey`** – Welcome, tutorial, and command introductions
  ```bash
  /hey
  ```
  Interactive onboarding experience for first-time users or when you need a refresher. Provides tutorial, system overview, and creates reference materials.

- **`/do`** – Capture project idea, conduct meeting, and refine
  ```bash
  /do                    # Full ideation workflow
  /do feature            # Add single feature idea
  /do now                # Fast-track with detailed prompt/PRD
  /do i'm lucky          # Get AI-suggested ideas
  ```
  Captures your project idea through iterative conversation, conducts discovery meeting, and refines suggestions. Generates IDEA.md, BRAINSTORM.md, and REFINEMENTS.md.

- **`/plan`** – Generate execution plan + tasks
  ```bash
  /plan
  ```
  Reads IDEA.md and BRAINSTORM.md, then generates TASKS.md with organized phases and feature folders.

#### Development Commands

- **`/dev`** – Start development workflow
  ```bash
  /dev                    # Start next task
  /dev --feature "auth"   # Start specific feature
  ```
  Finds next available task (or specific task), creates/checks out Git branch, syncs documentation, and starts time tracking.

#### System Commands

- **`/sys`** – System management and monitoring
  ```bash
  /sys performance    # View performance metrics and cache statistics
  /sys backup         # Create compressed project backups
  /sys restore        # Restore from backup
  /sys memory         # Export/import memory card
  /sys engagement     # View engagement dashboard
  ```

#### Team & Information Commands

### Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Create project
npx @doplan-dev/cli

# 2. Open in IDE
cd my-awesome-project
code .

# 3. In your IDE, start with onboarding (first time):
/hey

# 4. Capture your project idea
/do

# 5. Generate execution plan + tasks
/plan

# 6. Start development
/dev

# 7. Mark task complete when done
/done
```

---

## 🧠 Command Workflow

1. **Onboard & Capture** – Start with `/hey` for onboarding (first time), then `/do` to capture your project idea through iterative conversation, which automatically conducts a discovery meeting and refinement phase.
2. **Plan** – `/plan` reads IDEA.md and BRAINSTORM.md, then generates phased TASKS.md with organized phases and feature folders.
3. **Develop** – For each task: `/dev` (starts task, creates branch) → code → repeat.
4. **Manage & Monitor** – Use `/sys` commands to view engagement dashboard, performance metrics, create backups, manage memory card, and control system settings.

This end-to-end loop is generated with every project, so the same commands are available in Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Antigravity, Cline, and OpenCode without extra setup.

## 📟 Command Catalog

| Command | Phase | What it unlocks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/hey` | Onboarding | Welcome, tutorial, and command introductions |

## 📑 Docs, Changelog & Wiki

- `CHANGELOG.md` follows Keep a Changelog + SemVer. Check the **[latest entry](CHANGELOG.md)** (v1.3.0) for performance optimizations and new features.
- The `Docs/` tree mirrors what every generated project should publish (foundation, features, release, history). Use it as the canonical structure reference.
- The **[Complete Wiki](https://github.com/DoPlan-dev/CLI/tree/main/wiki)** is now organized in the repository with 9 sections and 52 files covering all features. The [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/DoPlan-dev/CLI/wiki) serves as a gateway to the complete documentation.
- Automation helpers such as `/state`, `/sys performance`, and `/github info` keep each of those artifacts aligned (KPI block, scan diffs, state history, and performance metrics).
