## Introduction
We present MGTEVAL, an extensible platform for systematic evaluation of MachineGenerated Text (MGT) detectors. Despite
rapid progress in MGT detection, existing evaluations are often fragmented across datasets,
preprocessing, attacks, and metrics, making results hard to compare and reproduce. MGTEVAL organizes the workflow into four components: Dataset Building, Dataset Attack, Detector Training, and Performance Evaluation. It supports constructing custom benchmarks by generating MGT with configurable
LLMs, applying 12 text attacks to test sets,
training detectors via a unified interface, and
reporting effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. The platform provides both commandline and Web-based interfaces for user-friendly
experimentation without code rewriting.
