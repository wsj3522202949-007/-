## Features

### AI-Generated Tags & Categories

<img src="assets/admin/images/features/auto-tags.svg" alt="Animated preview of AI-generated tags and categories" width="520">

Suggests new tags and categories based on your content, and automatically chooses the right tags and categories for your posts.

This feature also works in **bulk edit** mode: select multiple posts and let Superdraft set tags and categories for all of them in a background process. To avoid API rate limits, bulk processing is done with a delay between each post, which can be adjusted with the `superdraft_bulk_process_interval` filter (see the *Action and Filter Hooks* section below).

Features include:

- Analyze existing posts to suggest relevant tags and categories
- Customize the number of suggestions
- Adjust context length for better accuracy

### Clean, Customizable Prompts
Superdraft comes with easy-to-understand AI prompt templates that you can customize to suit your needs. Prompts are stored as text files in the `prompts` directory and can be easily overridden in your theme or child theme, or by using a custom plugin.

Prompts, like the rest of the plugin, are fully translatable and can be customized to suit your needs. Superdraft will automatically load the correct prompt based on your site's language settings and the available prompt files. Currently, the plugin ships with English and Hungarian prompts.

#### Custom Prompt Templates

You can find the following prompt templates in the `prompts` directory:
- `add-terms.txt`: Suggestions for adding new tags and categories based on the content of your recent posts
- `assign-terms.txt`: Suggestions for assigning tags and categories to your posts based on their content
- `autocomplete.txt`: Suggestions for text completion in the block editor based on the context around the cursor
- `smartcompose.txt`: Suggestions for inline sentence completion in the block editor based on the context before the cursor
- `writing-tips.txt`: Writing tips and content improvement suggestions
- `image-prompt.txt`: Generate image prompts based on the post title and content

To override the default prompts, copy the desired prompt file to your theme or child theme's `superdraft` directory. Superdraft will automatically load the custom prompt file if it exists. Optionally, you can use the `superdraft_prompt_directories` filter to add additional directories to search for prompt files, or use the other prompt-related filters to customize the prompt loading process (see the code examples below).

```php
// Add a custom prompts folder.
add_filter( 'superdraft_prompt_directories', function( $directories ) {
    // Append your custom directory (adjust the path as needed).
    $directories[] = WP_PLUGIN_DIR . '/my-plugin/prompts';
    return $directories;
});
```

With the above code, Superdraft will search for prompt files in the following directories:
- `/wp-content/plugins/my-plugin/prompts` (custom directory)
- `/wp-content/themes/your-child-theme/superdraft`
- `/wp-content/themes/your-theme/superdraft`
- `/wp-content/plugins/superdraft/prompts`

#### Prompt Template Syntax

Superdraft prompt templates use a simple syntax for variable placeholders and conditional blocks. Variables are enclosed in double curly braces (`{{variable}}`), while conditional blocks are enclosed in double parentheses with a question mark: (`((?conditional text with a {{variable}}))`). Conditional blocks are removed if all variables inside them evaluate to false (e.g. empty strings).

### Action and Filter Hooks
Superdraft provides a variety of hooks for developers to customize the plugin's behavior. These hooks allow you to modify the AI models, adjust the plugin's settings, and extend its functionality.

#### Filters

```

* `superdraft_prompt_template`

Parameters:
```
$template (string) – The current prompt template filename.
```

* `superdraft_pre_prompt_text`
Short-circuit prompt file reading by providing custom prompt text directly.
Parameters:

Parameters:
```
$models (array) – The list of available AI models.
```

#### Action Hooks

* `superdraft_bulk_process_completed`
Triggered when a bulk process is completed, so you can execute additional custom actions.

### Custom AI Models
Superdraft supports custom models: you can plug in any OpenAI-compatible API by providing the endpoint URL, model name, and API key. This feature allows you to use any model you have access to, including locally hosted models, or custom models you've trained yourself.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0 or higher
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- API key from supported AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests.

### JS Build Process

The JavaScript source files (located in the `src/` folder) are processed using Webpack. The build process starts from the entry points defined in `webpack.config.js` (e.g., `autocomplete.js`, `smartcompose.js`, etc.). This configuration is based on the default settings provided by the `@wordpress/scripts` package. A small adjustment is made to remove the Dependency Extraction plugin, ensuring that external dependencies (like various WordPress packages) remain external. The bundled, production-ready files are output to `/assets/admin/js/dist`, ready for use by the plugin.
