# 🌿 Smart Cultural Storyteller

> *"Every village has a story. Every story has a soul."*

</div>

## 📖 About

**Smart Cultural Storyteller** is an AI-powered web application that preserves and generates authentic folk narratives rooted in **Rural India** — inspired by the tradition of village elders sharing wisdom under a banyan tree.

Users can discover stories from a curated cultural database, or generate entirely new narratives using AI with control over mood, length, and theme. The platform blends modern generative AI with cultural sensitivity to keep India's oral storytelling traditions alive for the next generation.

> Inspired by Google's Rural India Storytelling initiative and AI Dungeon.

## 🧠 How It Works

```
User Input (mood + theme + length)
        ↓
   LangChain Prompt
        ↓
   OpenAI GPT-3.5
        ↓
  Cultural Story Text
        ↓
  ┌─────┴──────┐
  │            │
Image Gen   Audio TTS
(Optional) (Optional)
  │            │
  └─────┬──────┘
        ↓
  Gradio UI Display
```

The prompt is carefully engineered to ground every generated story in authentic Rural Indian culture — farming cycles, monsoon seasons, village festivals, family bonds, and elder wisdom.
