## What is M.A.R.I.A.?

**M.A.R.I.A.** is an author-driven ecosystem of local AI character projects built around `M.A.R.I.A.-Core`.

The name has several intentional interpretations:

```text
M.A.R.I.A.
├─ Myself As Real Intelligence Artifact
├─ My Artificial “Real” Intelligence Appearance
└─ Myself As Real Intelligence Appearance
```

All interpretations reflect different aspects of the project and are considered valid.

## Official repositories

| Repository | Description |
|---|---|
| [`M.A.R.I.A.-Micro-Engine`](https://github.com/HontoUKI/M.A.R.I.A.-Micro-Engine) | Public **community-tier** chat engine spun off from the ecosystem: character-pack driven, with an OpenAI-compatible API and relationship **stages** that let a character change *visibly and explainably* as the bond grows. Apache-2.0 — the accessible, **runnable** entry point to the project. |
| [`M.A.R.I.A.-Voice`](https://github.com/HontoUKI/M.A.R.I.A.-Voice) | External local voice runtime: STT, TTS, VAD, playback and diagnostics |

The full ecosystem is developed privately for now — the canonical **Core runtime**, a dedicated local **world-runtime** (perception & interaction), an **ML-driven perception brain**, a **cognitive memory / dossier** layer and a **controlled-agency** layer. This hub tracks their direction conceptually (see *Project status*); the **Micro-Engine** is the public, runnable slice you can actually try.

A **Presence-Shell** desktop client (Tauri — avatar rendering + window/audio bridge, replacing earlier Unity/Live2D plans) is built; CV (presence observer) and other clients remain future ideas.

Repositories using the `M.A.R.I.A.` naming but not listed here are not considered official parts of the ecosystem.

## Philosophy

M.A.R.I.A. is not designed as a generic “AI companion SaaS”.

The ecosystem is built around:

- authored identity;
- long-term continuity;
- presence over utility;
- subjective perception;
- imperfect and non-compliant behavior;
- single-user character runtime philosophy;
- separation between engine and identity.

The goal is not to create a perfect assistant.

The goal is to create a believable local character system capable of long-term interaction, memory, perception and emotional continuity.

## Ecosystem structure

```text
M.A.R.I.A.
├─ M.A.R.I.A.-Core               (private — canonical runtime)
├─ M.A.R.I.A.-Micro-Engine       (public — runnable community-tier engine)
├─ M.A.R.I.A.-Voice              (active, TTS/STT/VAD/playback)
├─ M.A.R.I.A.-Presence-Shell     (built, Tauri desktop shell —
│                                 avatar rendering + window/audio bridge;
│                                 replaces earlier Unity/Live2D plans)
├─ world-runtime                 (private — perception & interaction layer)
├─ ML perception brain           (private — trains the runtime's brain)
├─ cognitive memory / dossier    (private — meaning & becoming layer)
├─ M.A.R.I.A.-CV                 (future, presence observer)
└─ Other ecosystem modules
```

`M.A.R.I.A.-Core` remains the canonical runtime nucleus of the ecosystem.

## About the project

The ecosystem was originally created and is currently maintained by a single author.

M.A.R.I.A. is developed as an author-driven project focused on architecture, behavior systems, runtime continuity and long-term experimentation around local AI characters.

This repository exists as:

- ecosystem map;
- philosophical documentation;
- historical archive of project evolution;
- public entry point into the M.A.R.I.A. ecosystem.

## Timeline

- **2026-01-29** — first voice prototype: the project begins.
- **2026-03-16** — expanded character prototype.
- **April 2026** — AI coding agents join the workflow as accelerators *(the author still drives and reviews the architecture)*.
- **2026 →** — the Rebirth lines: Core slimming, perception extracted into a separate world-runtime, the ML brain, the cognitive memory / dossier + reflection layer and controlled agency. Recent lines have pushed the "perception lives in the ML brain, not hand-written rules" principle further — the character's read of a message (its emotion, warmth, and now the *conversational intent* itself) is a learned signal from her own brain rather than keyword logic in the runtime.

---

## Project status

M.A.R.I.A. is **actively developed**, but development is currently **author-driven and closed-doors**.

What that means in practice:

- There is **no public snapshot** of the current runtime — the accessible, runnable public slice is the **Micro-Engine**. The canonical Core and the newer layers are private.
- Since that snapshot the runtime has gone through many further **Rebirth lines**: the perception layer was extracted into a dedicated local **world-runtime**; perception is now driven by a self-written **ML brain**; a **cognitive memory / dossier + reflection** layer gives the character meaning and continuity; and a permission-gated **controlled-agency** layer gives her safe "hands". These modules are private for now.
- This hub is the **public window** into that direction — high-level, conceptual, no internal source.

The goal remains the same: a believable, local, single-user character system with long-term memory, subjective perception and emotional continuity — not a generic assistant.

## 📊 Code metrics

Production code vs tests across the ecosystem — source languages only (docs, data, generated and vendored files excluded), measured with [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei):

| Module | Production | Tests | Test-to-prod |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| `M.A.R.I.A.-Core` | 24 673 | 19 934 | **81%** |
| `M.A.R.I.A.-Voice` | 2 933 | 1 164 | 40% |
| `Presence-Shell` | 2 141 | — | — |
| Private modules *(world-runtime · ML brain · cognition)* | 12 702 | 3 076 | 24% |
| **Ecosystem total** | **42 449** | **24 174** | **57%** |

_Lines of code (Python · JS / JSX · Rust · CSS). Test-to-prod = test LOC as a share of production LOC._

Over the last refactoring line the **runtime core shrank** (≈ −1 900 lines of production code) while the **private perception / brain modules grew** (≈ +700) — logic keeps moving *out* of the decision core into the separate world-runtime and the ML brain, which is the whole direction of travel.

### Why so much code?

Almost all of it is **authored logic** — not vendored dependencies or framework boilerplate. The dependency base is deliberately lean:

| Module | Core dependencies |
|---|---|
| `M.A.R.I.A.-Core` | FastAPI · Pydantic · NumPy · PyYAML · Requests *(LLM runs locally via Ollama, over HTTP)* |
| `M.A.R.I.A.-Voice` | Pydantic *(TTS / STT engines loaded lazily as optional sidecars)* |
| `Presence-Shell` | React · PixiJS + Live2D · Tauri 2 (Rust) · Vite |
| Private modules | FastAPI · Pydantic · NumPy · scikit-learn *(the perception brain is hand-written)* |

No LangChain, no heavy agent frameworks, no giant ML stack — the perception brain is a self-written NumPy / scikit-learn model, and the LLM runs locally through Ollama. The line count reflects **hand-written behavior, memory, perception and test code**, not libraries.

## Following development & future contribution

- **To follow along:** watch / star this repository — direction updates and narrative land here.
- **Contribution is not open yet.** The project is intentionally single-author and closed-doors while the architecture stabilizes.
- **For the future:** collaboration may open later. If the philosophy resonates and you'd want to be involved down the line, the welcome path is to follow the project, read the philosophy/concepts docs, and reach out via the repository (issues/discussions) — no code contributions are expected or accepted at this stage.
