## ⚙️ Technical Details

- **Database**: SQLite3
- **API**: RESTful architecture

### File Structure
```
ESSAYAIAGENTPRJ/
├── app.py                 # Flask backend (all API endpoints)
├── index.html             # SPA frontend (6 tabs)
├── essays.db              # SQLite database (created on first run)
├── .env                   # Environment variables
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── README.md             # Full documentation (this file)

└── .gitignore            # Git ignore file
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Students table
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT UNIQUE,
  profile_data TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Drafts table
CREATE TABLE drafts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id INTEGER,
  essay_type TEXT,
  title TEXT,
  content TEXT,
  version INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id)
);
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- ⚠️ **NEVER commit `.env` file** - contains API key
- ✅ Use `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
- 🔐 API key is only used server-side, never exposed to browser
- 📝 Drafts are stored locally in SQLite
- 🛡️ CORS is configured for development only

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "OPENAI_API_KEY not found"
**Solution**: Check `.env` file has correct API key with no quotes

### Error: "Connection refused"
**Solution**: Make sure Flask server is running (`python app.py`)

### Error: "ModuleNotFoundError"
**Solution**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Slow responses
**Normal**: Essay generation takes 10-30 seconds. This is expected.

### CORS errors
**Solution**: Use `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (not `localhost`)

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Customizing Prompts
Edit the prompt templates in `app.py` to match your school's specific requirements or focus areas.

### Running on Different Port
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='127.0.0.1', port=8000)
```

### Production Deployment
For production, consider:
- Using Gunicorn instead of Flask development server
- Deploying to Heroku, Render, or Railway
- Using PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
- Setting up proper logging and monitoring

## 📚 College Essay Best Practices

### What Admissions Officers Want
1. **Authentic voice** - writes like a real person, not a robot
2. **Specific details** - shows not tells
3. **Self-awareness** - reflects on growth and lessons

2. Bragging or achievement listing
3. Formal/artificial language (try to impress = fail)
4. Clichés ("sports taught me teamwork")
5. Grammar errors (shows lack of care)

### The 5 Essay Winners ✅
1. Authentic, conversational voice
2. Vivid, specific examples and details
3. Clear growth/insight/reflection
4. Vulnerability + strength balanced
5. Flawless grammar + powerful words
