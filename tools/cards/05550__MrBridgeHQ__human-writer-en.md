# Human Writer - English

Make English AI text read as human-authored, and audit any English draft with a **deterministic 0-100 AI-detection score** before you publish. A Claude Code Agent Skill.

The English member of the `human-writer` per-language family (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Arabic, Hindi). Each member installs side by side and activates only on its own language triggers.

## Three modes

- **Write:** produce new English content already engineered to score low-risk.
- **Clean:** rewrite an existing English AI draft to strip detector tells, preserving meaning.
- **Audit:** score a English draft, surface the worst tells, and recommend fixes without rewriting it.

Four content types are supported (marketing long-form, short-form comms, technical docs, editorial-SEO), each with its own tolerances.

## Why it exists

Modern LLM output is fluent enough to ship but carries fingerprints that commercial detectors (Copyleaks, GPTZero, Originality.ai) latch onto: low burstiness, repeated vocabulary, formulaic frames, and typographic tells. A draft rejected at 70 percent or more does not need a rewrite from scratch; it needs a disciplined sweep of the specific tells the detectors weight. This skill encodes that doctrine for English and ships a scorer, targeting sub-25 percent AI-probability on Copyleaks and GPTZero.

## English-specific doctrine

- A roughly 200-entry suspect vocabulary (delve, leverage, seamless, robust) plus a 54-pattern AI-construction regex bank.
- The single English typographic tell is the em-dash (U+2014); the analyzer counts its density directly.
- A tricolon detector (the "X, Y, and Z" rhythm) and boilerplate conclusion frames ("In conclusion", "Ultimately", "All in all").

## The analyzer

`scripts/analyze.py` is a deterministic 0-100 scorer that runs offline (it loads `rules.yaml`; optional live scoring via Copyleaks, GPTZero, or Originality.ai with `--external`).

```bash
python3 skills/human-writer-en/scripts/analyze.py --input draft.md --lang en --type marketing --format human
```

Score bands: 0-24 low-risk (ship it), 25-49 medium (apply the top fixes and re-score), 50-74 high, 75-100 critical.

## Installation

```bash
cp -r skills/human-writer-en ~/.claude/skills/
pip install -r skills/human-writer-en/requirements.txt   # pyyaml required, httpx optional
```

Or copy `skills/human-writer-en` into a project's `.claude/skills/` directory.

## Use it

Once installed, the skill auto-activates on English prose requests. Example prompts:

- "Write a 600-word blog post and make it read human, not AI"
- "Clean this AI draft to bring its Copyleaks score under 25"
- "Audit this email for AI tells before I send it to a client"
- "Score this article for AI-detection risk and tell me what to fix first"

Force activation: "Use the `human-writer-en` skill to ...".

## What is inside

The skill lives in [`skills/human-writer-en/`](skills/human-writer-en/): a `SKILL.md` (routing, master checklist, anti-patterns), a `references/` library (stylistic, statistical, and structural tells, humanization techniques, and per-content-type adapters), and `scripts/` (`rules.yaml` plus the `analyze.py` 0-100 scorer and its tests).
