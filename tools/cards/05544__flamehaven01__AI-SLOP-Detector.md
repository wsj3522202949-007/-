**Release track**
- Stable tag: `v3.8.8`
- Previous stable tag: `v3.8.7`
- `v3.8.8` tightens operational reliability: packaging metadata now uses SPDX string form, the VS Code extension's `Refresh Issues` command performs a real workspace re-scan, sidebar results no longer linger after files are renamed or removed, exact file-path selection avoids basename collisions, and Quick Fixes now write `ignore` / `phantom_import_allowlist` entries into `.slopconfig.yaml` with duplicate protection.
- `v3.8.7` was the false-positive reduction pass: `.claude/**` worktrees are ignored by default, JS/TS fallback callback-hell detection no longer confuses JSX or object-literal braces for nested callbacks, phantom-import resolution now understands monorepo package roots plus aliases like `grpcio -> grpc`, clone grouping uses a stricter clique+size model with property-accessor exemptions, and self-dogfood weighted deficit improves from `9.3892` to `6.4186`.

## What Is AI-SLOP Detector?

AI-SLOP Detector is an **evidence-based static analyzer** that targets the specific defect class AI code generation reliably produces: structurally plausible code that is functionally empty, disconnected, or misleading.

General linters flag style and convention. This tool flags structural risk.

- **27 checks for "fake-done" code** — empty stubs, imports that don't resolve, dead pipelines, copy-paste clones, and buzzword-padded docs
- **One 0–100 risk score per file** — four measurements are combined so one bad dimension can't be hidden behind good ones (weighted geometric mean of logic density, jargon inflation, dependency use, and critical severity)
- **Can tune itself to one repository over time** — repeated scan/edit history becomes a project-scoped calibration signal, so review sensitivity can adapt without a separate training workflow (kicks in automatically after ~10 multi-run files). This is operational calibration, not external validation.
- **Tells real changes from noise** — uses your commit history so a score drifting a point or two isn't mistaken for a real regression
- **Knows your project type** — `--init` detects the domain (web API, data/ML, numerical, CLI, library, bio, finance, or general) and picks sensible defaults; override with `--domain`
- **Python first, JS/TS and Go optional** — install the `[js]` or `[go]` extra to scan those files too
- **Drops into CI** — soft / hard / quarantine gates, GitHub Actions ready
- **VS Code extension** — inline warnings as you type, score in the status bar

---

## Why Not Just Use a Linter?

Ruff, pylint, ESLint, and SonarQube primarily check syntax, style, and general static-quality rules. They'll happily pass code that follows every rule and still does nothing — which is exactly what AI assistants tend to produce. This tool checks the other half: **does the code actually do what it claims?**

| Can it catch... | ruff / pylint / SonarQube | AI-SLOP Detector |
|---|---|---|
| Style, formatting, syntax | Yes | No (not its job) |
| An empty function with a real-looking body or fake return | No | Yes |
| A module imported but never actually used downstream | Partial (unused-import) | Yes (usage ratio) |
| A handler or pipeline that's defined but never wired in | No | Yes |
| Docs or comments that oversell what the code does | No | Yes |
| Copy-pasted duplicate functions across files | Partial | Partial (exact duplicates) |
| Runs offline, no API key, deterministic core score | Yes | Yes |

Use a linter for correctness-of-form. Use this for "is this code real, or just plausible-looking." The two are complementary — run both.

## When NOT to Use This

- **You want style or formatting enforcement** — use ruff / black / ESLint. This tool ignores style on purpose.
- **You need a runtime correctness guarantee** — a low score means cleaner structure, not that the code works. Keep your tests.
- **Your code isn't Python, JS/TS, or Go** — other languages aren't analyzed yet.
- **You expect calibrated thresholds on day one** — the first runs are un-calibrated and only begin to accumulate repository-specific calibration evidence after ~10 multi-run files. Treat early findings as leads, not verdicts.

---

## 60-Second First Run

No project-side config needed. Run it against any folder of Python:

```bash
pip install "ai-slop-detector>=3.8.8"
slop-detector --project . --json --output slop.json
python -c "import json; d=json.load(open('slop.json',encoding='utf-8')); print(d['overall_status'], d['weighted_deficit_score'])"
```

Expected output for a healthy project: `clean 0.0` to `clean 30.0`. Anything
above `30.0` is a real finding worth reading in `slop.json`. The `--output`
form writes UTF-8 (no BOM) directly to disk, so it is safe under Windows
PowerShell — prefer it to `> slop.json` redirection.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install "ai-slop-detector>=3.8.8"

slop-detector scan .                        # canonical analysis entry
slop-detector review . --json              # canonical changed-code review
slop-detector pulse . --json               # canonical repo health view
slop-detector sweep dead-code . --json     # canonical cleanup family

# legacy / compatible surface
slop-detector --init                       # bootstrap baseline .slopconfig.yaml + .gitignore
slop-detector --init --adaptive-init --init-preview
slop-detector --init --adaptive-init --apply-init-suggestions
slop-detector mycode.py                    # single file
slop-detector --project ./src             # entire project
slop-detector --project . --json --output slop.json   # machine-readable output (Windows-safe)
slop-detector --project . --ci-mode hard --ci-report  # CI gate

# Optional extras
pip install "ai-slop-detector[js]"       # JS/TS tree-sitter analysis
pip install "ai-slop-detector[go]"       # Go tree-sitter analysis

# Thin npm wrapper (delegates to the Python CLI)
npm install --save-dev ai-slop-detector
# or: pnpm add -D ai-slop-detector / yarn add -D ai-slop-detector / bun add -d ai-slop-detector

# Python backend still required
pip install ai-slop-detector

npx ai-slop-detector scan .
npx ai-slop-detector review . --format json
npx ai-slop-detector pulse . --format json
npx ai-slop-detector sweep dead-code . --format json
npx ai-slop-detector mcp

# Typed output contract
import type { ReviewOutput, ScanOutput } from "ai-slop-detector/types"

# Programmatic Node API
import { scanProject, reviewChanges, computeHealth, runCleanupFamily } from "ai-slop-detector"

# Local impact story
slop-detector impact enable .
slop-detector impact .

# Telemetry controls (default: off)
slop-detector telemetry status
slop-detector telemetry inspect --example

# Local wrapper development
cd npm-wrapper
node ./bin/ai-slop-detector.js --version

# No install required
uvx ai-slop-detector mycode.py
```

The npm surface is intentionally thin:

- it does **not** reimplement analysis logic
- it delegates into the Python CLI/runtime
- it exists for Node-first teams that want `npx`-style entry without changing
  product semantics
- it requires a Python backend and discovers it in this order:
  `AI_SLOP_DETECTOR_EXECUTABLE` -> active `VIRTUAL_ENV` -> PATH executables ->
  `python -m slop_detector.cli`
- it ships version-pinned TypeScript interfaces at `ai-slop-detector/types`
- it exports a small async Node API for `scanProject`, `reviewChanges`,
  `computeHealth`, and `runCleanupFamily`

> **Windows / PowerShell tip:** PowerShell `>` redirection writes UTF-16 LE
> or UTF-8 with BOM by default, which breaks `json.load(..., encoding='utf-8')`.
> Use `--output <path>` instead — it writes UTF-8 bytes (no BOM) directly,
> skipping the shell.

---

## Verification Path

Use the same verification surface the repository exposes in CI:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest -q
ruff check src tests
python -m build
```

Governance verification is a separate enforcement gate:

```bash
slop-detector verify-governance ./.cr-ep
```

See [docs/GOVERNANCE.md](docs/GOVERNANCE.md) for the artifact contract and
policy checks.

Operational review commands live on the same CLI entry point:

```bash
slop-detector review . --json
slop-detector pulse . --json
slop-detector sweep dead-code . --json
slop-detector sweep dupes . --json
slop-detector sweep unused-deps . --json
slop-detector sweep boundary-violations . --json
slop-detector watch . --follow
slop-detector explain dead-code
```

Legacy command forms such as `audit`, `health`, and direct cleanup-family names
remain supported for compatibility, but `scan / review / pulse / sweep` are the
preferred stable surface.

Cleanup-family semantics are now more operational than a raw candidate list:

- `dead-code`, `dupes`, `unused-deps`, `stale-suppressions`, and
  `boundary-violations` emit `confidence`, `action_class`, and `evidence`
- `unused-deps` includes project-manifest findings such as
  `manifest_unused_dependency` and `undeclared_import`
- `boundary-violations` stays cycle-only by default and only enables layered
  boundary review when architecture rules are explicitly configured

Agent tooling can use the same semantics over MCP stdio:

```bash
slop-detector mcp
# or
slop-mcp
```

Adoption and observability surfaces are intentionally separate from scoring:

- `slop-detector impact` tracks local, gitignored repository progress in
  `.slop-detector/impact.json`
- `slop-detector telemetry` stays default-off and only builds anonymized
  payloads; `AI_SLOP_DETECTOR_TELEMETRY=inspect` prints a real payload without
  queueing it

---

## Scope And Boundaries

- This repository measures static code and documentation signals. It does not prove runtime correctness.
- The default scoring path is deterministic; it does not require an LLM or external API.
- JS/TS and Go support are optional extras with language-specific analyzers and fallbacks.
- Optional Rust acceleration is available for file discovery and glob matching when a compiled `rust/slop_scan` helper is present; otherwise the Python walker remains the fallback.
- Narrow framework-aware masking is enabled for test boilerplate (pytest no-op hooks, test-harness console/no-op hooks in JS/TS) and never masks `critical` findings.
- A low deficit score is evidence of cleaner structure, not a guarantee that the code is complete or safe.

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[📄 Source File] --> R[FileRole\nClassifier]
    R --> B[AST Parser]
    B --> C[27 Pattern Checks]
    B --> D[LDR · ICR · DDC\n+ Purity Metrics]

    F -->|≥ 70| J[🚨 CRITICAL_DEFICIT]
    E --> H2[history.db]
    H2 --> K[Self-Calibrator\nauto-tune weights]
```

Every file goes through **four** independent measurement axes (LDR, ICR, DDC,
Purity) **and** 27 pattern checks. Results are combined via a **weighted
geometric mean** — a near-zero in any single dimension pulls the overall score
down regardless of other dimensions. Every scan is recorded to history (per project); at every
10 multi-run files milestone the calibrator fires — weights apply only when >= 5 improvement
events and >= 5 fp_candidate events per class have accumulated.

## What It Detects

**27 patterns across 5 categories.** Full catalog: [docs/PATTERNS.md](docs/PATTERNS.md)

| Category | Patterns | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| **Placeholder** | `empty_except`, `not_implemented`, `pass_placeholder`, `ellipsis_placeholder`, `return_none_placeholder`, `return_constant_stub`, `todo_comment`, `fixme_comment`, `hack_comment`, `xxx_comment`, `interface_only_class` | Unfinished / scaffolded code |
| **Structural** | `bare_except`, `mutable_default_arg`, `star_import`, `global_statement` | Anti-patterns |
| **Cross-Language** | `javascript_array_push`, `java_equals_method`, `ruby_each`, `go_print`, `csharp_length`, `php_strlen` | Wrong-language syntax |
| **Python Advanced** | `god_function`, `dead_code`, `deep_nesting`, `lint_escape`, `exact_duplicate_pair`, `function_clone_cluster`, `placeholder_variable_naming` | Structural complexity + evasion |
| **Phantom** | `phantom_import` | Hallucinated packages |

**Four metric axes per file:**

| Metric | What it measures |
|---|---|
| **LDR** (Logic Density Ratio) | `logic_lines / total_lines` — code vs. whitespace/comments |
| **ICR** (Inflation Check) | `jargon_density × complexity_modifier` — buzzword weight |
| **DDC** (Dependency Check) | `used_imports / total_imports` — import utilization |
| **Purity** | `exp(-0.5 × n_critical_patterns)` — AND-gate on critical pattern severity |

---

## Scoring Model

```
purity        = exp(-0.5 × n_critical_patterns)
quality (GQG) = exp( Σ wᵢ·ln(max(1e-4, dimᵢ)) / Σ wᵢ )   — weighted geometric mean
deficit_score = 100 × (1 − quality) + pattern_penalty
```

`max(1e-4, ...)` prevents `log(0) = -inf` from collapsing the entire score (v3.7.2 `__post_init__` guards enforce upstream range invariants on metric results).

| Score | Status |
|---|---|
| ≥ 70 | `CRITICAL_DEFICIT` |
| ≥ 50 | `INFLATED_SIGNAL` |
| ≥ 30 | `SUSPICIOUS` |
| < 30 | `CLEAN` |

Default weights: `ldr=0.40 · inflation=0.30 · ddc=0.20 · purity=0.10` — sum is 1.00; GQG divides by `total_w` so exact normalization is not required (all four calibrated via `--self-calibrate` in v3.2.0+)
Project aggregation uses SR9 conservative weighting: `0.6 × min + 0.4 × mean`

Full specification: [docs/MATH_MODELS.md](docs/MATH_MODELS.md)

### Readable, actionable output

Scores are not a black box. Every project and file report renders each metric
with its **value**, **healthy direction**, and a one-line **what it means**, plus
a deficit-band legend:

```
Project Metrics
  Metric                          Value     Healthy   What It Means
  Average Deficit Score           6.1/100   Lower     Mean file risk; 0 is clean, 100 is severe.
  Logic Density Ratio (LDR)       95.36%    Higher    Share of code lines that contain real implementation.
  Inflation-to-Code Ratio (ICR)   0.00x     Lower     Unjustified jargon vs. average cyclomatic complexity.
  Dependency Usage Ratio (DDC)    86.00%    Higher    Imported libraries referenced by runtime code.
  Deficit bands: CLEAN <30 | SUSPICIOUS 30-50 | INFLATED 50-70 | CRITICAL >=70
```

Each report ends with deterministic **Next Steps** — the top concern, the
recommended `sweep` command, and the highest-priority file to open — so analysis
turns directly into action. The same wording is shared by the rich, text, and
markdown renderers.

### Per-file `deficit_breakdown` (v3.7.6)

Every per-file result in the JSON output also carries a `deficit_breakdown`
that attributes the score back to its source dimensions. This answers
"why is my clean-status file not 0.0?" without drilling into raw findings:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ldr_penalty` | Points of deficit attributable to low logic density |
| `inflation_penalty` | Points from buzzword / docstring inflation |
| `ddc_penalty` | Points from low import-usage ratio |
| `purity_penalty` | Points from critical-severity pattern hits via GQG |
| `pattern_hits` | Additive pattern penalty (post-cap) |
| `total` | Equals `deficit_score` (sum of the above when not capped at 100) |

GQG-dimension shares are computed via log-loss attribution — the sum of the
five penalty fields equals `total` within `0.01` when `deficit_score < 100`.

### Structural Coherence Level

`coherence_level` in project-level JSON output reports how the
`structural_coherence` value was derived:

| Value | Meaning | When emitted |
|---|---|---|
| `vr_structural` | Vietoris-Rips H0 persistence over file DCFs (MST max edge) | At least two parsed Python files with non-empty DCFs |
| `vr_structural_approx` | Deterministic approximation of the same signal above the exact topology ceiling | At least two parsed Python files, with file count above `advanced.exact_topology_ceiling` |
| `none` | No coherence computed | Empty project, single file, or all files unparseable |

`mst_persistence` and `not_applicable` are **not** emitted — they were
proposed in the v3.7.5 audit but never wired in. Verify the actual value
from the JSON output rather than guessing.

---

## Key Features

**Bootstrap** — domain-aware, one command to start
```bash
slop-detector --init                   # auto-detect domain, generate .slopconfig.yaml
slop-detector --init --domain web/api       # explicit domain override
slop-detector --init --adaptive-init --init-preview
slop-detector --init --adaptive-init --apply-init-suggestions
```
`--init` detects your project domain from file patterns (8 built-in profiles:
`general`, `scientific/ml`, `scientific/numerical`, `web/api`,
`library/sdk`, `cli/tool`, `bio`, `finance`) and pre-seeds the weight profile
accordingly. Also secures `.slopconfig.yaml` in `.gitignore` by default.

Adaptive init is now a separate safety layer:

- `--init --adaptive-init --init-preview`
  - scans the repository
  - prints evidence-backed config suggestions
  - writes nothing
- `--init --adaptive-init --apply-init-suggestions`
  - opt-in merge path
  - preserves unknown handwritten keys
  - only applies conservative suggestions

---

**JS/TS Analysis** — optional tree-sitter path
```bash
pip install "ai-slop-detector[js]"
slop-detector --project ./src         # now includes .js/.jsx/.ts/.tsx files
```
Activates JSAnalyzer v2.8.0 with tree-sitter AST (regex fallback when not installed).
Results appear under `js_file_results` in `ProjectAnalysis` and JSON output.

---

**Go Analysis** — regex-based, optional tree-sitter-go path
```bash
pip install "ai-slop-detector[go]"
slop-detector --project ./src         # now includes .go files
```
Activates GoAnalyzer v1.0.0. Detects: empty function stubs, `panic()` as error handling,
`fmt.Println/Printf` debug prints, `_ =` ignored errors, TODO/FIXME comments, god functions
(> 60 lines). Results appear under `go_file_results` in JSON output.

---

**Self-Calibration** — repository-local weight tuning
```bash
slop-detector . --self-calibrate               # see what your history recommends
slop-detector . --self-calibrate --apply-calibration  # write to .slopconfig.yaml
```
4D grid-search (ldr / inflation / ddc / purity) over repository-local run
history. This is an **operational calibration** layer: it tunes review
sensitivity to observed edit/review behaviour in one project. It is not an
independent external validation of the score or a governance control by itself.
- **Project-scoped** — `history.db` tags every record with a `project_id` (sha256 of cwd); calibration signal never mixes across different projects
- **Domain-anchored** — grid search is constrained to ±0.15 around the current domain weights, preventing drift outside the domain's meaningful weight region
- **Drift warnings** — `CalibrationResult.warnings` flags any dimension that shifted > 0.25 from the anchor
- Only applies when confidence gap between top two candidates exceeds 0.10
- Milestone is triggered by files re-scanned (not raw record count), avoiding false triggers on first-time project scans

**History Tracking** — longitudinal quality analysis
```bash
slop-detector mycode.py --show-history   # per-file trend
slop-detector --history-trends           # 7-day project aggregate
slop-detector --export-history data.jsonl
```
Every run auto-recorded to `~/.slop-detector/history.db`. The history database is
the repository-local signal source for operational calibration and trend review.

## Claude Code Integration

```bash
cp -r claude-skills/slop-detector ~/.claude/skills/
# restart Claude Code, then use the canonical review surfaces below
```

Adds a persistent JSON-first review loop inside Claude Code:
`review → inspect evidence → apply bounded fixes → pulse/sweep → human handoff`.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `slop-detector review . --format json` | Changed-code review with verdict, attribution, targets, actions, and findings |
| `slop-detector pulse . --format json` | Health summary plus hotspot prioritization |
| `slop-detector sweep <family> . --format json` | Cleanup planning for dead code, duplication, deps, stale suppressions, or boundaries |
| `slop-detector scan . --format json` | Full baseline analysis when the agent needs the complete core report |
| `slop-detector verify-governance <artifact>` | Governance artifact verification kept separate from score output |

Recommended use:

- start with `review` for PR-like work
- use `pulse` to decide what to fix next
- use `sweep` only for bounded cleanup families
- re-run after each patch instead of assuming the first diagnosis still holds
- escalate to a human with evidence, not just a score

## Empirical Weight Calibration (LEDA)

Most static analyzers ship with hand-tuned thresholds — or none at all. AI-SLOP
Detector can tune its 4D weights from repository-local review/edit history
instead of forcing one fixed profile everywhere. That makes the calibration
path reproducible and auditable, but it does **not** make the score externally
validated by itself. The current claim is narrower: the tool can adapt its
review sensitivity to one repository's observed behavior using explicit rules.

    F --> G{Confidence Gap ≥ 0.10?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Global Injector\nSynthesizes Weights]
    H --> I[DOMAIN_PROFILES Updated]
```

1. **Dogfooding** — `leda_turbo.bat` runs a `Scan → Auto-Fix → Rescan` loop over diverse external codebases, safely applying patterns like `bare_except` and `mutable_default_arg`.
2. **Event Labeling** — deficit drop + git commit = `improvement_event`; a stable unchanged file after a prior flag = `fp_candidate`.
3. **Self-Calibration** — 4D grid search (±0.15 domain-anchored). Weights update only when the `confidence_gap` between improvement events and FP candidates exceeds **0.10**.
4. **Global Synthesis** — `global_injector.py` harvests signals across all dogfooding repos, synthesizes a vote-weighted optimal profile, and injects it into `DOMAIN_PROFILES["general"]`.

Use this as an internal calibration aid, not as proof that the score measures a
single externally validated latent condition. See [docs/VALIDATION.md](docs/VALIDATION.md)
for the current validation boundary.

## Security Considerations

### `.slopconfig.yaml` sensitivity

Your `.slopconfig.yaml` contains `domain_overrides` — a precise map of which functions
are exempt from complexity rules. This is effectively a **codebase weakness surface**:
it reveals which areas are too complex to refactor right now.

**Best practice:**
- Run `slop-detector --init` to generate `.slopconfig.yaml` and auto-add it to `.gitignore`
- To share governance config with your team, explicitly remove `.slopconfig.yaml` from `.gitignore`
- Open-source repos committing it is fine (transparency over obscurity — see this project's own `.slopconfig.yaml`)

### `history.db`

History is stored at `~/.slop-detector/history.db` (your home directory, outside all repos).
It is never committed and accumulates across all projects you scan.

---

**Adversarial Validation (SPAR-Code)** — ground-truth regression guard
```bash
fhval spar          # 3-layer adversarial check
fhval spar --layer a   # known-pattern anchors
fhval spar --layer c   # existence probes
```
Verifies each metric is measuring what it claims. Catches calibration drift
before it reaches production.

---

**Structural Coherence** — project-level signal
```python
project = detector.analyze_project("./src")
print(project.structural_coherence)  # 0.0 – 1.0
```
Experimental. Use for longitudinal comparison within a project, not as an
absolute gate. Exact MST topology is used up to
`advanced.exact_topology_ceiling` (default `300` files); above that the engine
switches to a deterministic approximation and reports
`coherence_level = "vr_structural_approx"`. [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## CI/CD Integration

**pre-commit** (runs on every commit):
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/flamehaven01/AI-SLOP-Detector
    rev: v3.7.3
    hooks:
      - id: slop-detector          # hard gate — fails on CRITICAL_DEFICIT >= 70
      # - id: slop-detector-warn   # soft mode — reports only, never blocks
      # - id: slop-detector-patterns  # fast per-file pattern scan
```

**GitHub Actions** (runs on every PR):
```yaml
# .github/workflows/quality-gate.yml
- name: AI-SLOP Gate
  run: |
    pip install "ai-slop-detector>=3.7.3"
    slop-detector --project . --ci-mode hard --ci-report
```

**Enforcement modes:**
```bash
--ci-mode soft        # informational, never fails build
--ci-mode hard        # fails: deficit_score >= 70, critical_patterns >= 3, inflation >= 1.5, ddc < 0.5
--ci-mode quarantine  # escalates repeat offenders after 3 violations
```

## Inline Suppression

Use inline suppression when a specific local exception is intentional and should
remain visible in audit output:

```python
# slop-disable-next-line bare_except
except:
    pass

# slop-disable all
def compatibility_layer():
    ...
# slop-enable all
```

- `# slop-disable-next-line <pattern_id|all>`
- `# slop-disable <pattern_id|all>`
- `# slop-enable <pattern_id|all>`

Suppressed findings are removed from scoring, but they are still recorded in the
suppression ledger so reviewers can see which lines were muted.

---

## Repeated-Run Cache

Repeated Python-file analysis can reuse prior results through the SQLite-backed
metadata cache:

```yaml
advanced:
  analysis_cache_enabled: true
  analysis_cache_db: ""  # empty = default user cache under ~/.slop-detector/
```

- Cache keys include file path, size, `mtime`, content hash, engine version, and config fingerprint.
- A changed file or changed config invalidates only the affected entries.
- Current scope is Python file analysis reuse; project aggregation still recomputes from the live file set.

---

## Priority Hotspots

Project scans now rank repair order instead of only printing static scores.
The hotspot layer combines:

- deficit score
- recent git churn
- coverage gap from `.coverage`

When present, the report highlights files that are both sloppy and risky to
change because they churn often or remain under-tested. If git metadata or
coverage data is missing, the prioritization layer degrades gracefully instead
of failing the scan.

---

## Agent Surface

The FastAPI server exposes an agent-native contract alongside the existing
human-oriented `/analyze/*` routes:

- `GET /agent/schema`
- `POST /agent/file`
- `POST /agent/project`

These routes return structured snapshots with summary metrics, suppression
metadata, hotspot ranking, and the raw analysis payload so tools can consume
the results without scraping text output.

## VS Code Extension

Real-time inline diagnostics, debounced lint-on-type, ML score and purity signal in status bar. v3.7.1 rebuilt from a single 855-line monolith into eight focused modules.

**What you see:**

| Surface | Detail |
|---|---|
| Status bar | `$(error) SLOP 45.2` — severity icon + deficit score, updates on save |
| Inline diagnostics | Pattern issues with line references — phantom imports, god functions, lint escapes |
| **TreeView sidebar** | Activity bar panel: files sorted by deficit score, metric rows (LDR/DDC/Purity/Inflation), issue list with click-to-navigate |
| **CodeLens** | Line 0: file summary (`SLOP 45.2 — 3 CRITICAL`); per-function: top severity icon + pattern IDs |
| **QuickFix (CodeAction)** | Lightbulb on `phantom_import`/`god_function`/`lint_escape` diagnostics — show output or add to `.slopconfig.yaml` ignore |
| ML signal | `ML: 73% [slop]` in summary diagnostic when `[ml]` extra is installed |
