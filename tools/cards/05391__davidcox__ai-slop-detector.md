# 🔬 AI Slop Detector

  <em>"What do you mean humans only have five fingers?"</em>
</p>

A browser extension that highlights common AI writing patterns — spaced em dashes, "delve," hedging phrases, and other tells — directly on any web page you're reading.

> **Full disclosure:** This extension was written entirely by an AI. Yes, we know. The irony is not lost on us. If you find tells in *this* README, consider it a integration test.

---

## What it does

Click the extension icon, hit **Scan Page**, and every detected AI-ism gets highlighted inline with color-coded severity. Hover any highlight for a tooltip explaining the rule. The popup summarizes the findings and renders a verdict.

This is **not** an ML classifier. There's no server, no account, no API call. It's a simple rule-based linter that runs locally in your browser. It can't tell you whether something was written by AI — it can only show you the patterns that correlate with AI output at higher-than-human rates.

Think of it as a code linter, but for prose.

## Why rule-based?

ML-based AI detectors (GPTZero, Copyleaks, etc.) give you a probability score but can't explain *why*. They're black boxes. They also require sending text to a server and often cost money.

This extension does the opposite:

- **Transparent.** Every rule is a named pattern with a plain-English description of why it's suspicious.
- **Local.** Nothing leaves your browser. Ever.
- **Educational.** You learn what the tells are instead of trusting a number.
- **Free.** Obviously.

The tradeoff is that it's easy to fool and easy to trigger on human writing. That's fine. It's a reading aid, not a courtroom exhibit.

## Rules (27)

### High severity — strong signals

| Rule | What it catches |
|------|----------------|
| Spaced em dash | `word — word` (most style guides use unspaced) |
| "Delve" | Almost nobody writes this unprompted |
| "Embark" | "Embark on a journey…" |
| "It's worth noting" | Classic AI hedge |
| "It's important to note" | Ditto |
| "In today's [X]" | "In today's fast-paced world…" |
| "Let's dive in" | The canonical AI transition |
| "In the realm of" | Formulaic topic opener |
| Exclamatory opener | "Great question!", "Absolutely!" |

### Medium severity — suggestive

| Rule | What it catches |
|------|----------------|
| Double em dash | Two em dashes in one sentence |
| "Tapestry" (metaphorical) | LLM-favorite metaphor |
| "Leverage" as verb | Corporate-AI tell |
| "Multifaceted" | Padding adjective |
| "Realm" | Filler noun |
| "Foster" | "Foster innovation…" |
| "Underscores" | "This underscores the importance…" |
| "Whether you're" | Formulaic inclusive construction |
| "In conclusion" | Rare in natural prose |
| "At its core" | AI transition to sound insightful |

### Low severity — weak individually, accumulate

| Rule | What it catches |
|------|-------------related:
  - methods/最强去AI味铁律.md
  - methods/改稿润色指令库.md
---|
| "Landscape" (metaphorical) | "The AI landscape…" |
| "Robust" | Overrepresented in AI text |
| "Comprehensive" | AI describes everything as comprehensive |
| "Crucial" / "Pivotal" | Disproportionate AI intensifiers |
| "Cutting-edge" | Hyphenated cliché |
| "Streamline" | Corporate AI favorite |
| "Navigate" (metaphorical) | "Navigate challenges…" |
| "Game-changer" | Hype word |
| "Furthermore" / "Moreover" | Formal conjunctive adverbs |
| "Not just X, but Y" | Overused rhetorical construction |

## Install

### From source (developer mode)

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-slop-detector.git
cd ai-slop-detector
npm run build

# Then in your browser:
# Chrome:  chrome://extensions → Enable Developer Mode → Load unpacked → select dist/
# Firefox: about:debugging → This Firefox → Load Temporary Add-on → select dist/manifest.json
# Edge:    edge://extensions → Enable Developer Mode → Load unpacked → select dist/
```

### From a release zip

Download the latest `.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-slop-detector/releases), unzip it, and load unpacked as above.

## Also available for VS Code and Word

This repo also includes a **VS Code extension** (`vscode-extension/`) and a **Microsoft Word add-in** (`word-addin/`) that share the same rule set (`rules/rules.json`) and matching engine (`rules/engine.js`).

> **Fair warning:** The VS Code and Word plugins are *literally untested by a human.* They were written entirely by AI, verified only by automated checks, and have never been loaded into their respective applications. They might work perfectly. They might catch fire. Caveat emptor.

See each directory's README for setup instructions.

## Development

```bash
npm install          # Install dev dependencies (just zip tooling)
npm run build        # Copy src/ → dist/, ready to load
npm run package      # Build + create ai-slop-detector.zip for distribution
npm run clean        # Remove dist/ and zip artifacts
npm run watch        # Rebuild on file changes (requires fswatch or similar)
```

The source lives in `src/`. There's no transpilation, no bundler, no framework — it's vanilla JS and CSS that runs directly in the browser. The "build" step is just copying files into `dist/` so you have a clean directory to point the browser at.

### Adding a rule

Rules live in `src/content.js` in the `RULES` array. Each rule is an object:

```javascript
{
  id: "my-new-rule",           // kebab-case identifier
  name: '"My phrase"',          // display name for popup/tooltip
  description: "Why this is suspicious.",
  severity: "high",             // "high" | "medium" | "low"
  pattern: /\bmy phrase\b/gi,   // regex — set global flag
}
```

For rules that need more logic than a single regex, use `testFn` instead of `pattern`:

```javascript
{
  id: "complex-rule",
  name: "Complex rule",
  description: "Needs custom logic.",
  severity: "medium",
  pattern: null,
  testFn(text) {
    // Return array of { start, end } match ranges
    return [];
  },
}
```

## Limitations

- **High false-positive rate.** Human writers use em dashes, say "robust," and write "in conclusion." A single hit means nothing. Look at the pattern of accumulation.
- **English only.** The rules are English-language patterns.
- **No context awareness.** It doesn't know if "landscape" is literal (a painting) or metaphorical (the AI landscape). It flags both.
- **Static scan.** It scans on button press. Dynamically loaded content (infinite scroll, SPAs) may need a re-scan.
- **Content scripts can't reach everything.** Browser-internal pages (`chrome://`, `about:`, PDFs) are off limits.

## Contributing

PRs welcome, especially for new rules. If you've noticed an AI writing pattern that isn't covered, open an issue with examples.

Please test new rules against both AI-generated and human-written text to assess false-positive rates. A rule that fires on every New Yorker article is not useful.
