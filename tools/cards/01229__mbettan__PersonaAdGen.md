### Tools

The agent has access to the following tools:

- `create_persona_brief_without_headlines(persona: str, core_message: str, tone: str, location: str, demographics: str, interests: str) -> dict`: Creates the initial persona brief structure before headline generation.

- `generate_headlines(persona: str, core_message: str, tone: str) -> list[str]`: Automatically generates compelling headlines based on the persona story.

- `save_image_as_artifact(image_data: str) -> str`: Processes and saves uploaded images as artifacts for scene generation.

- `confirm_and_save_persona_brief(brief: dict) -> str`: Saves the complete creative brief to session state.

- `edit_scene_image(base_image: str, scene_prompt: str, scene_number: int) -> str`: Generates new advertising scenes based on edit prompts using the uploaded image as source.

- `debug_save_image(image_data: str, filename: str) -> str`: Debug utility for image processing and storage operations.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- Google ADK SDK
- Google Cloud Project (for Vertex AI integration) or Google AI Studio API key
- GCS bucket for artifact storage

### Installation

1. **Prerequisites:**

   For the Agent Engine deployment steps, you will need a Google Cloud Project. Once you have created your project, [install the Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). Then run the following command to authenticate with your project:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   
   You also need to enable certain APIs. Run the following command to enable the required APIs:
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com storage.googleapis.com
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mbettan/PersonaAdGen.git
   cd PersonaAdGen
   ```

3. Install dependencies using Poetry:

   If you have not installed poetry before then run `pip install poetry` first. Then you can create your virtual environment and install all dependencies using:

   **Note for Linux users:** If you get an error related to `keyring` during the installation, you can disable it by running the following command:
   ```bash
   poetry config keyring.enabled false
   ```
   This is a one-time setup.

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

   To activate the virtual environment run:
   ```bash
   poetry env activate
   ```

4. Install evaluation dependencies (optional):

   For running evaluation tests, you need additional dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install "google-adk[eval]"
   
   # If using pipx for ADK installation
   pipx inject google-adk pandas tabulate rouge-score
   ```

5. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```bash
   # Google Cloud Project Configuration
   export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
   export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
   
   # Artifact Storage Configuration
   export ADK_ARTIFACT_SERVICE_TYPE=GCS
   export ADK_GCS_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
   
   # For Vertex AI (set to true if using Vertex AI)
   export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true
   
   # For Google AI Studio (if not using Vertex AI)
   # export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=false
   # export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

## Running the Agent

You can run the agent using the ADK command in your terminal from the root project directory:

1. Run agent in CLI:

   ```bash
   adk run persona_ad_gen
   ```

2. Run agent with ADK Web UI:

   ```bash
   adk web
   ```
   
   The web interface will be available at the URL printed in the console (typically http://localhost:5000)

3. Alternative execution methods:

   ```bash
   # Using the run script (if available)
   ./run_agent.sh
   
   # Direct Python execution
   python -m adk.web_server --app persona_ad_gen
   ```

### Example Interaction

Here's a typical interaction flow with the agent:

**User:**
hello

**Agent:**
Great ads connect with a real person by solving a real problem. Instead of just filling out a form, we're going to build your ad's story step-by-step. First, let's get to know your ideal customer.

Describe the single person you want to reach. What is a key problem, need, or desire they are currently facing that your business can help with?

**User:**
I want to reach busy professionals in their 30s who struggle to find time for fitness but want to stay healthy and look good.

**Agent:**
Perfect! You're targeting busy professionals who value their health but struggle with time management. Now, let's capture the core message.

Now, imagine that person sees your ad. In one powerful sentence, what is the solution or key takeaway you want them to have? This is the core message that will form the heart of your ad.

**User:**
"Get fit in just 20 minutes a day with workouts that fit your schedule, not the other way around."

**Agent:**
Excellent core message! It directly addresses their time constraint while promising results. Now let's think about the tone.

How should we speak to this person? Choose a Tone of Voice that would resonate with them (e.g., Professional, Empathetic, Witty, Urgent, Conversational, Inspiring).

**User:**
Inspiring and empathetic - understanding their struggle but motivating them to take action.

**Agent:**
Perfect tone choice! Inspiring and empathetic will resonate well with busy professionals who need both understanding and motivation.

You've defined the story, now let's gather the materials. Upload your most compelling image that will serve as the foundation for your advertising scenes.

[User uploads image]

**Agent:**
Perfect! Now I'll automatically generate compelling headlines for you based on your story.

```tool_code
generate_headlines(
    persona="busy professionals in their 30s struggling with time for fitness",
    core_message="Get fit in just 20 minutes a day with workouts that fit your schedule",
    tone="Inspiring and empathetic"
)
```

```tool_outputs
[
    "Your Schedule. Your Workout. Your Success.",
    "20 Minutes to Transform: Fitness That Fits Your Life",
    "Busy Schedule? We Get It. 20 Minutes Is All You Need.",
    "From Boardroom to Better Health in 20 Minutes",
    "Finally, Fitness That Respects Your Time"
]
```

## Evaluating the Agent

Evaluation tests assess the agent's conversation flow and response accuracy.

**Steps:**

1. **Run Evaluation Tests:**

   ```bash
   adk eval persona_ad_gen eval/data/persona_ad_gen_evalset.test.json
   ```

   Expected output:
   ```
   Eval Run Summary
   persona_ad_gen_evalset:
     Tests passed: 2
     Tests failed: 0
   ```

2. **Run Unit Tests:**

   ```bash
   pytest eval/test_eval.py
   ```

   This runs specific test cases including:
   - `test_agent_introduction` - Verifies the agent provides the correct introduction

### Automated End-to-End Testing

For a full, unattended validation of the agent (including headline and image generation), you can use the provided test utility. This script simulates a complete user interaction flow.

**Steps:**

1.  **Ensure Environment Variables are Set**: Ensure `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`, and `ADK_GCS_BUCKET_NAME` are either in your `.env` file or exported in your shell.

2.  **Run the Test Script**:
    ```bash
    poetry run python run_persona_test.py docs/assets/example_scene.jpg
    ```

The script will iterate through a pre-defined conversation, process the image, and generate advertising scenes, saving them as artifacts in the `.adk/artifacts/` directory.

## Configuration

The agent uses the following models:
- **Main Agent:** `gemini-3-flash-preview` for conversation and reasoning
- **Scene Transformation:** `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` for transforming base images into ad scenes
- **Video Extension:** `veo-3.1-generate-001` for extending scenes into cinematic 8-second videos

You can modify these in `persona_ad_gen/agent.py`:

```python
MODEL = "gemini-3-flash-preview"  # Change this to use a different model
```

### Session State Structure

The agent maintains the following session state:

```python
{
    "confirmed_brief": {
        "persona": str,
        "core_message": str,
        "tone": str,
        "location": str,
        "demographics": str,
        "interests": str
    },
    "base_image_filename": str,
    "headlines": list[str],
    "generated_scenes": list[str]
}
```

## Deployment on Google Agent Engine

To deploy the agent to Vertex AI Agent Engine:

1. **Install deployment dependencies:**
