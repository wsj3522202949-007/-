[中文说明](https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills/blob/main/README.zh-CN.md) | English

Human Writing Skills is an open-source skill pack and lightweight prompt compiler for AI-assisted writing.

It helps a writing agent move away from generic, template-shaped output and toward prose that has intention, texture, continuity, and genre discipline. The project is especially useful for long-form generation, where characters, settings, arguments, facts, and unresolved threads often drift after several passages.

The goal is not deception. The goal is better writing: clearer instructions, stronger revision habits, and reusable style constraints that make AI-assisted drafts feel edited by a human.

## Why This Exists

AI writing often fails in predictable ways:

| Problem | What this project adds |
| --- | --- |
| Generic "AI voice" | Concrete revision checks for rhythm, specificity, and empty phrasing |
| One style fits every genre | Separate Markdown `SKILLS` for different writing forms |
| Long text loses continuity | A compact ledger for facts, plot, promises, and voice anchors |
| Prompts become messy | A CLI that compiles style, context, and task into one clean instruction pack |
| Advice stays abstract | Rules are written as observable editing actions |

## Built-In Style Skills

| Skill | Use it for | Main focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fiction` | literary or commercial fiction | point of view, scene pressure, character behavior |
| `argumentative` | essays and opinion pieces | thesis, evidence, counterargument, logical flow |
| `news-report` | news-style reports | factual order, attribution, neutral wording |
| `self-media` | social posts and creator essays | useful voice without empty hype |
| `academic-paper` | research writing | cautious claims, structure, terminology |
| `webnovel` | serialized genre fiction | hooks, payoffs, power rules, continuity |

## Deep Human-Trace Modules

These modules target deeper AI-writing artifacts, not only surface phrases.

| Module | What it repairs |
| --- | --- |
| `controlled-drift` | overly smooth logic, no associative movement, no unfinished thought |
| `narrative-bridges` | weak scene turns, generic transitions, paragraphs that do not cause each other |
| `relationship-state` | relationships that reset, dialogue without leverage, forgotten secrets or boundaries |
| `relationship-stance-audit` | audience-specific stance checks for rivalries, affairs, factions, hierarchy, sects, and family politics |
| `logic-causality-audit` | cause, timeline, knowledge, motive, rule, resource, and consequence failures |
| `character-consistency-audit` | character goal, voice, competence, boundary, knowledge, and change-gate drift |
| `dialogue-voice-audit` | interchangeable speakers, response-tactic drift, and audience-inappropriate register |
| `serial-reentry` | recap dumps and chapter resets when prior chapters or a ledger are supplied |
| `chapter-momentum-audit` | atmosphere-only chapters, missing payoffs, discarded residue, and unsupported hooks |
| `narrative-distance-control` | unmotivated zoom, missing orientation, and viewpoint-distance drift |
| `imagery-load-audit` | stacked comparisons, competing sensory channels, and show-then-gloss repetition |
| `paragraph-rhythm-audit` | mechanical one-line paragraph runs and overloaded long blocks |
| `detail-disclosure-audit` | biography and appearance inventories delivered before the scene uses them |
| `scene-entry-audit` | exact-time/location/weather/outfit opening bundles before pressure-bearing action |
| `natural-measurement` | false precision: tiny exact measures and counted micro-actions in narrative prose |
| `cliche-phrase-audit` | stock phrases, generic body cues, empty emotion labels, and dead transitions |
| `formulaic-structure-audit` | triplets, symmetrical frames, and paragraphs that resolve too neatly |
| `prose-progress-audit` | polished paragraphs that do not add a new fact, action, proof, or pressure |
| `imperfect-prose` | prose that is too clean, too symmetrical, or too polished |
| `vocal-rhythm` | flat cadence and missing read-aloud breath points |
| `embodied-emotion` | emotion labels without body, action, contradiction, or perception |
| `cultural-anchors` | vacuum prose with no era, place, community, or material detail |
| `spatial-blocking` | character teleportation and confused front/back/left/right blocking |
| `occupancy-capacity` | over-occupied or mode-ambiguous seats, benches, beds, stools, aisles, and surfaces |
| `appearance-prop-continuity` | clothing, shoes, props, injuries, and daily-detail drift |
| `physical-continuity-audit` | final checks for position, movement gates, wardrobe, and props |
| `proofreading-audit` | final typo, punctuation, naming, repetition, layout, and formatting checks |
| `style-matrix` | the mistake of applying one generic "human voice" to every genre |
| `editor-loop` | one-shot drafting without a critical human-editor pass |
| `ai-trace-rubric` | vague feedback like "sounds AI" without diagnosis |
| `reference-style-alignment` | explicit reference material into transferable voice features without copying content |
| `protected-content` | accidental changes to numbers, citations, equations, URLs, code, quotes, and required terms |

## Quick Start

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills.git
cd human-writing-skills
python -m pip install .

human-writing-skills list --kind style
human-writing-skills list --kind module
human-writing-skills build --style fiction --context examples/story-ledger.md --task "Write the next scene."
```

You can also run directly from the source checkout with `python -m humanwriting.cli ...`. The `build` command prints an instruction pack that can be pasted into Codex, ChatGPT, Claude, local LLM tools, or another writing agent.

## Example Output Shape

```text
# Core Directive
# Continuity Protocol
# Selected Skill: fiction
# Project Context
# Task
# Output Contract
```

This format keeps the model focused on the current task while still carrying the previous facts, style decisions, and unresolved threads.

## Explicit Reference Style

Reference matching is opt-in. It activates only with `--reference`,
`--reference-style`, or explicit task wording such as "match this voice." A
continuity ledger by itself never activates it.

```powershell
human-writing-skills build `
  --style fiction `
  --context examples/story-ledger.md `
  --reference examples/reference-style-source.zh-CN.md `
  --task "Continue the scene while matching the reference's restrained rhythm."

human-writing-skills audit `
  --draft my-chapter.md `
  --reference examples/reference-style-source.zh-CN.md `
  --profile style-match
```

The compiler extracts point of view, rhythm, register, imagery, description,
dialogue cadence, emotion handling, and transitions. Plot facts still come from
`--context`; names, events, and distinctive phrases must not be copied from the
reference. See [docs/reference-style.md](https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills/blob/main/docs/reference-style.md).

## Long-Form Continuity

For longer works, this project recommends a small ledger instead of relying only on a large context window.

The ledger tracks:

- fixed facts: names, dates, locations, relationships, rules, timeline
- active threads: unresolved conflicts, clues, promises, open arguments
- relationship state: who knows, wants, hides, owes, refuses, or holds leverage
- relationship stance: public/private posture, current audience, mention policy, forbidden leaks, and exception motives
- voice anchors: point of view, diction, pacing, formality, taboo phrases
- current state: where the previous passage ended and what must connect next
- beat bridge: previous residue, entry pressure, micro-turn, and exit hook
- change log: what became newly true in the latest output

See [examples/story-ledger.md](https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills/blob/main/examples/story-ledger.md) for a fiction example.

## Chatbox

Yes, this project works in Chatbox because it outputs plain text prompt packs. For long writing sessions, use the continuity ledger as the source of truth and paste the compiled prompt pack into Chatbox's system prompt or first message.

- Chinese guide: [docs/chatbox.zh-CN.md](https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills/blob/main/docs/chatbox.zh-CN.md)
- Ledger template: [examples/chatbox-ledger-template.md](https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills/blob/main/examples/chatbox-ledger-template.md)

## Physical Continuity

For scenes where space matters, such as cars, elevators, hospital rooms, dining tables, and bedrooms, use `--strict-continuity`. It adds occupancy, spatial blocking, and appearance/prop generation guards. Use `audit --profile physical` for a forensic pass on an existing draft.

```powershell
python -m humanwriting.cli build `
  --style fiction `
  --strict-continuity `
  --review `
  --context examples/vehicle-scene-ledger.md `
  --task "Continue the car argument. Every seat change must have an on-page transition. Keep clothing and props consistent."
```

- Draft audit example: [examples/problem-car-scene-draft.md](https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills/blob/main/examples/problem-car-scene-draft.md)

## Relationship Stance Continuity

For scenes with rival factions, secret relationships, hierarchy, family politics,
office politics, or sect leaders, use `--deep-review` or add `relationship-stance-audit`.
It extracts each dialogue line as `speaker -> listener/audience -> referenced party`
and checks whether praise, criticism, comparison, naming, secrecy, and rank fit
the established relationship graph.

- Guide: [docs/relationship-stance-continuity.md](https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills/blob/main/docs/relationship-stance-continuity.md)
- Ledger template: [examples/relationship-stance-ledger.zh-CN.md](https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills/blob/main/examples/relationship-stance-ledger.zh-CN.md)

If the draft already exists, use `audit`:

```powershell
python -m humanwriting.cli audit `
  --draft examples/problem-car-scene-draft.md `
  --context examples/vehicle-scene-ledger.md
```

## Project Layout

skills/              reusable writing SKILLS in Markdown

```

## CLI Usage

### Optional Narrative Modules

The new narrative controls are progressive-disclosure modules. They are not added by
default, by `--review`, by `--deep-review`, or by the broad `full` audit:

```powershell
human-writing-skills build --style fiction --module dialogue-voice-audit --task "Write the negotiation."
human-writing-skills build --style webnovel --context ledger.md --module serial-reentry --task "Continue chapter 18."
human-writing-skills audit --draft chapters.md --profile momentum
human-writing-skills audit --draft chapter.md --profile texture
```

Use `dialogue-voice-audit` for distinguishable speakers, `serial-reentry` only with
prior chapters or a ledger, `momentum` for a multi-chapter draft, and `texture` for
narrative distance, cinematic opening stacks, imagery load, paragraph fragmentation,
emotional over-explanation, and detail inventory.

### Audit Profiles

`audit` can load only the checks needed for the current pass:

| Profile | Purpose |
| --- | related:
  - methods/网文写作最强SOP.md
  - methods/最强写作方法论_全球最强综合版.md
related:
  - methods/网文写作最强SOP.md
  - methods/最强写作方法论_全球最强综合版.md
--- |
| `full` | Broad default audit; optional `voice`, `serial`, `momentum`, and `texture` remain separate |
| `logic` | Cause, timeline, knowledge, motive, rules, resources, and consequences |
| `character` | Character goal, voice, competence, boundaries, and change gates |
| `voice` | Speaker fingerprints, response tactics, register, and interchangeable dialogue |
| `serial` | Recap dumps, missing carryovers, and chapter resets; requires `--context` |
| `momentum` | Multi-chapter entry pressure, irreversible turns, payoff, residue, and exit pressure |
| `texture` | Narrative distance, scene-entry load, imagery, paragraph cadence, and detail disclosure |
| `physical` | Position, capacity, reach, clothing, props, and injuries |
| `relationship` | Audience, stance, information permissions, rank, and secret leaks |
| `ai-trace` | Cliches, formulaic structure, static paragraphs, and other AI traces |
| `numbers` | False precision in action and emotion |
| `proofread` | Typos, punctuation, naming, layout, and mechanical errors |
| `style-match` | Drift from explicitly supplied reference material; unavailable without a reference signal |

Profiles can be combined, for example `--profile relationship --profile ai-trace`.

### Multi-Stage Pipeline

For high-precision review, generate independent single-purpose passes instead of asking one model to check everything at once:

```powershell
human-writing-skills pipeline `
  --draft my-chapter.md `
  --context my-novel-ledger.md `
  --auto `
  --output-dir chapter-audit
```

Run every stage in a fresh model conversation or independent API request. Automatic mode keeps logic, AI-trace, and proofreading stages, then adds character, relationship, physical, number, voice, serial, momentum, and texture stages only when matching cues exist. `serial` additionally requires supplied context; `momentum` requires multi-chapter structure. The manifest explains every selection and skip.

- Guide: [docs/audit-pipeline.md](https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills/blob/main/docs/audit-pipeline.md)

### Deterministic Safeguards

Use `lint` for evidence-located pattern checks and `verify` to catch protected
facts changed during rewriting. The lint score is an editing heuristic, not
authorship proof.

Protected-content instructions auto-load only for academic papers, news reports,
and strongly identified legal or technical documents. Fiction, webnovels, casual
Q&A, playful text, and self-media do not auto-load them; use `--protect-content`
or `--protect-term` to override this gate.

```powershell
human-writing-skills lint --draft my-chapter.md --style fiction
human-writing-skills verify --source original.md --candidate revised.md --protect-term "Project Atlas"
```

- Pattern lint: [docs/pattern-linter.md](https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills/blob/main/docs/pattern-linter.md)
- Protected content: [docs/protected-content.md](https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills/blob/main/docs/protected-content.md)

### Number Sense

Use this to catch false precision such as unnecessary exact centimeters, seconds, or micro-counts in emotional and bodily action, while preserving necessary numbers in medicine, forensics, engineering, architecture, news, and technical writing.

```powershell
python -m humanwriting.cli audit `
  --draft examples/false-precision-draft.zh-CN.md `
  --profile numbers
```

- Guide: [docs/number-sense.md](https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills/blob/main/docs/number-sense.md)
- Example: [examples/false-precision-draft.zh-CN.md](https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills/blob/main/examples/false-precision-draft.zh-CN.md)

### Common Writing Problems

The project converts recurring long-form writing problems into executable checks: stock phrasing, plastic prose, triplet structures, over-smooth transitions, static paragraphs, hollow emotion, cultural vacuum, and long-form drift.

- Rule map: [docs/forum-complaint-research.md](https://github.com/whh110112/human-writing-skills/blob/main/docs/forum-complaint-research.md)

List styles:

```powershell
python -m humanwriting.cli list
```

Build a prompt pack:

```powershell
python -m humanwriting.cli build `
  --style webnovel `
  --module narrative-bridges `
  --module relationship-state `
  --module natural-measurement `
  --module embodied-emotion `
  --module vocal-rhythm `
  --strict-continuity `
  --review `
  --context examples/story-ledger.md `
  --task "Continue chapter 3. Keep the confrontation unresolved but reveal one new clue."
```

The compact `--review` flag adds only:

- `editor-loop`: draft, diagnose, locally rewrite, then finalize
- `ai-trace-rubric`: score cognitive smoothness, generic diction, emotional flatness, rhythm monotony, context drift, weak beat bridges, relationship resets, false precision, cultural vacuum, over-clean prose, and closure addiction

The `--deep-review` flag adds the compact review plus:

- `relationship-stance-audit`: check speaker, listener, referenced party, secrecy, stance, rank, and audience permissions
- `cliche-phrase-audit`: check stock phrases, generic body cues, empty emotion labels, and dead transitions
- `formulaic-structure-audit`: check triplets, symmetrical frames, and paragraphs that close too neatly
- `prose-progress-audit`: check whether each paragraph advances facts, relationships, evidence, action, or pressure
- `natural-measurement`: check false precision in fiction, webnovels, and self-media

The `--strict-continuity` flag adds:

- `spatial-blocking`: position and movement checks
- `occupancy-capacity`: physical resource mode, capacity, occupancy, and transformation checks
- `appearance-prop-continuity`: clothing, shoes, props, and body-state checks

Use `audit --profile physical` for the final physical-state contradiction pass.

Run tests:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Writing Philosophy

Good AI-assisted prose should be:

- situated: it knows who is speaking, what changed, and why this passage exists
- specific: it uses details that belong to this topic, not any topic
- continuous: it respects previous facts, costs, injuries, claims, and promises
- shaped: it understands the genre before choosing structure and diction
- revised: it removes filler, canned transitions, and decorative certainty

## Editorial Guardrails

This project avoids claiming that any tool can perfectly hide authorship or beat detectors. It focuses on craft: voice, context, genre, revision, and continuity.

When studying published work, use short analysis, public-domain sources, licensed material, or your own examples. Do not copy protected passages into skills.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Useful additions include:

- new Markdown skills
- Chinese and multilingual style packs
- model-specific adapters
- stronger continuity ledger examples
- tests for prompt compilation and context preservation

Please keep each skill practical. A good rule should tell the model what to do, what to avoid, and how to check the result.
