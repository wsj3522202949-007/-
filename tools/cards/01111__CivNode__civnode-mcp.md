# CivNode MCP Server

MCP server for [CivNode](https://civnode.com) — the AI-powered creative writing platform where every human gets exactly one page (a Monument) displayed at random. No algorithm, no likes, no followers.

**263 tools** for writing, world-building (characters, locations, creatures, plots, family trees), entity exploration, books, collections, showcase, research, marketplace, library, forums, competitions, collaboration, passage comments, civic room, file management, and platform administration.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @civnode/mcp
```

No installation required. The server runs via `npx` and communicates over stdio using the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "civnode": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@civnode/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CIVNODE_SESSION_TOKEN": "your-session-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

Add to `.claude/settings.json` or `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "civnode": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@civnode/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CIVNODE_SESSION_TOKEN": "your-session-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `CIVNODE_SESSION_TOKEN` | For authenticated tools | Your CivNode session token |
| `CIVNODE_API_URL` | No | API base URL (default: `https://civnode.com`) |

## Authentication

Tools fall into three categories:

- **Public** — No token needed. Browse monuments, read works, search users.
- **Authenticated** — Requires `CIVNODE_SESSION_TOKEN`. Publishing, messaging, managing your compendium.
- **Admin** — Requires a token with admin role. System management, moderation, bot simulation. These tools only appear when a token is configured.

To get a session token, log in to CivNode and go to Settings → API Token.

## Local Development

To run against a local CivNode instance:

```bash
CIVNODE_API_URL=http://localhost:9080 CIVNODE_SESSION_TOKEN=your-token npx @civnode/mcp
```

Or in your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "civnode-local": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@civnode/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CIVNODE_API_URL": "http://localhost:9080",
        "CIVNODE_SESSION_TOKEN": "your-local-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Authentication required"** — Set the `CIVNODE_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variable. Get a token from Settings → API Token on CivNode.

**"Forbidden"** — Your token doesn't have permission for that action. Admin tools require admin role.

**"Rate limit exceeded"** — Wait a moment and retry. CivNode rate-limits API calls per user.

**"API error: 404"** — The resource doesn't exist or you don't have access. Check the UUID.

**Admin tools not showing** — Admin tools only appear when `CIVNODE_SESSION_TOKEN` is set. They also require server-side admin role.

**Wrong API URL** — By default the server connects to `https://civnode.com`. Set `CIVNODE_API_URL` for local development.

## Contributing

### Adding a New Tool

1. Add a tool object to the `tools` array in `index.js` (or the admin section for admin tools):

```javascript
{
  name: "tool_name",
  description: "What it does. Mention auth requirement.",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      id: { type: "string", description: "Resource UUID" },
    },
    required: ["id"],
  },
  handler: (args) => fetchAPI(`/api/endpoint/${args.id}`),
},
```

2. Use the existing HTTP helpers: `fetchAPI` (GET), `postAPI` (POST), `putAPI` (PUT), `patchAPI` (PATCH), `deleteAPI` (DELETE).

3. Update the tool count in the header comment and `package.json`.

4. Test locally: `CIVNODE_API_URL=http://localhost:9080 node index.js`

5. Bump version in `package.json` and push to main — CI auto-publishes to npm.
