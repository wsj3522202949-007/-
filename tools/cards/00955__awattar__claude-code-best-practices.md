A practical guide to using Claude Code, Anthropic’s agentic coding assistant, effectively in real-world development workflows. This repo distills best practices, patterns, and examples for integrating Claude Code into your terminal-based coding environment.

## ✨ What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is a command-line tool that gives you direct access to Claude’s reasoning and coding capabilities. It’s designed for agentic coding - where Claude autonomously explores, edits, and explains code across your project.

  Comprehensive test execution and improvement with framework detection, targeted test runs, coverage analysis, and automated fixes.


## 🤖 Specialized AI Agents

This repository includes a collection of 10 specialized AI agents that provide domain-specific expertise across all development workflows. These agents work automatically with commands to deliver expert-level capabilities in architecture, development, and quality assurance.

> **Note:** Commands also leverage Claude Code's built-in [`general-purpose`](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents) agent for complex multi-step analysis and file searching. It ships with Claude Code, so it is not defined in this repository.

### 🏗️ Core Infrastructure Agents

- [`general-solution-architect`](https://github.com/awattar/claude-code-best-practices/blob/main/.claude/agents/general-solution-architect.md)  
  Architecture analysis, technology stack decisions, scalability planning, and distributed systems design.

- [`general-technical-writer`](https://github.com/awattar/claude-code-best-practices/blob/main/.claude/agents/general-technical-writer.md)  
  Documentation creation, API documentation, formatting, and technical content organization.

- [`general-pm`](https://github.com/awattar/claude-code-best-practices/blob/main/.claude/agents/general-pm.md)  
  Product management oversight — issue creation, prioritization, progress tracking, and lifecycle management.

### 💻 Development Specialists

- [`general-fullstack-developer`](https://github.com/awattar/claude-code-best-practices/blob/main/.claude/agents/general-fullstack-developer.md)  
  End-to-end feature implementation spanning database, API, and frontend layers with seamless integration.

- [`general-backend-developer`](https://github.com/awattar/claude-code-best-practices/blob/main/.claude/agents/general-backend-developer.md)  
  API development, database design, server-side logic, and backend performance optimization.

- [`general-frontend-developer`](https://github.com/awattar/claude-code-best-practices/blob/main/.claude/agents/general-frontend-developer.md)  
  UI/UX implementation, component patterns, browser automation, and modern JavaScript frameworks.

- [`general-devops`](https://github.com/awattar/claude-code-best-practices/blob/main/.claude/agents/general-devops.md)  
  Infrastructure automation, CI/CD pipeline design, container orchestration, and reliability engineering.

### 🛡️ Quality Assurance & Leadership

- [`general-qa`](https://github.com/awattar/claude-code-best-practices/blob/main/.claude/agents/general-qa.md)  
  Testing strategies, test automation, comprehensive validation, and quality assurance methodologies.

- [`general-code-quality-debugger`](https://github.com/awattar/claude-code-best-practices/blob/main/.claude/agents/general-code-quality-debugger.md)  
  Code review, systematic debugging, refactoring guidance, and technical debt reduction.

- [`general-technical-project-lead`](https://github.com/awattar/claude-code-best-practices/blob/main/.claude/agents/general-technical-project-lead.md)  
  Security assessments, strategic technical decisions, performance optimization, and architectural leadership.

**Agent Integration:** These specialized agents work seamlessly with all custom commands, automatically providing domain expertise when needed. Commands like `/issue`, `/reviewpr`, and `/test` leverage multiple agents to deliver comprehensive, expert-level results.


## 🧩 Skills

Skills are model-invoked capabilities: instead of being triggered by a slash command, Claude Code loads them **automatically** when the task matches the skill's `description`. Each skill lives in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and instructions in the body.

This repository includes one example:

- [`conventional-commits`](https://github.com/awattar/claude-code-best-practices/blob/main/.claude/skills/conventional-commits/SKILL.md)  
  Automatically enforces the project's commit format whenever a commit message is being authored — no command needed.

**Skills vs. commands vs. agents:**

| Mechanism | Trigger | Best for |
|-----------|---------|-------related:
  - methods/网文写作最强SOP.md
  - methods/最强写作方法论_全球最强综合版.md
---|
| **Slash command** | User types `/name` | Explicit, on-demand workflows |
| **Skill** | Claude matches the `description` | Conventions and know-how that should apply automatically |
| **Subagent** | Delegated by Claude or a command | Heavy, focused work that should run in its own context window so it doesn't crowd the main session |

See the [Skills documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) for authoring details, including bundling scripts and reference files alongside `SKILL.md`.


## ⚙️ Project Configuration

The repository ships a checked-in [`.claude/settings.json`](https://github.com/awattar/claude-code-best-practices/blob/main/.claude/settings.json) that demonstrates two of the most useful project-level configuration mechanisms:

### Permissions

Scoped `allow` / `ask` / `deny` rules let Claude Code run safe, routine commands (`git status`, `gh pr view`, etc.) without prompting, require confirmation for riskier ones (`git push`), and block reads of sensitive files (`.env`, `secrets/`). Tune these to your team's risk tolerance — settings are merged from user, project, and local scopes.

### Hooks

Hooks register shell commands that run automatically on lifecycle events (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, etc.). The bundled example uses a `Stop` hook to print `git status --short` at the end of every turn so you always see what changed. Other common patterns:

- **`PostToolUse`** matching `Edit|Write` — auto-format or lint files after Claude edits them.
- **`PreToolUse`** matching `Bash` — block dangerous commands before they execute.
- **`Stop`** — send a desktop/Slack notification when Claude finishes a long task.

See the [Hooks documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) for the full event list and JSON schema.
