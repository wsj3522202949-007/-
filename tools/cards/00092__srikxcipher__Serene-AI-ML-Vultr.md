## Requirements

### Software Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-CORS
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- vaderSentiment
- numpy
- csv
- random
- logging
- json

### Python Libraries to Install:

```bash
pip install flask flask-cors scikit-learn pandas vaderSentiment numpy
```

Setup Instructions
------------------

Follow these steps to set up **SERENE-AI** on your local machine or server:

### 1\. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine or cloud server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srikxcipher/SERENE-AI.git
cd SERENE-AI
```
### 2\. Install Required Python Packages

Create and activate a virtual environment for the project (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\Scripts\activate'`
```
Then, install all the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3\. Prepare the Data

**Habit Data**: Make sure the `habit_data.csv` file is present in the project directory. This file should contain historical user data related to habits, including columns like:

-   `exercise_frequency`
-   `social_media_hours`
-   `stress_level`
-   `mindfulness_frequency`
-   `recommended_habit`

**Music Data**: Make sure the `music_data.csv` file is present in the project directory. This file should contain columns like:

-   `mood`
-   `title`
-   `file_path`

**Response Data**: Ensure the `responses.csv` file is available to store chatbot responses with sentiment classifications (positive, neutral, negative).

### 4\. Launch the Flask App

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```
This will start the Flask development server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or the configured host/port). The application will be running and accessible for API requests.

The APIs are designed to be consumed by any client application that can make HTTP requests. In your Android app (or other frontend), you can use the following approach:

1.  **POST Requests**: Make POST requests to the endpoints and pass the required data (as shown in the examples).
2.  **Parse the JSON Response**: After making the request, parse the JSON response to display the recommendations, writing prompts, or chatbot responses to users.
3.  **User Interaction**: Use the chatbot and AI writing therapist to engage users, and provide personalized wellness content such as music and habit suggestions based on user preferences and moods.
