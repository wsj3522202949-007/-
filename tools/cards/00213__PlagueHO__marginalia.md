> *Your manuscript deserves more than a spell-checker.*



Marginalia is an AI-powered editorial assistant for long-form writers. Upload a Word document or paste your draft, describe what you want improved, and let AI analyze your prose paragraph by paragraph — surfacing compressed narrative, inconsistent tone, awkward repetition, and opportunities for expansion. Review every suggestion with full rationale, accept or reject with a click, steer the AI with your own instructions, then export a polished `.docx` — all without losing your voice.



![Marginalia — analyzing a manuscript with suggestions](https://github.com/PlagueHO/marginalia/blob/main/docs/public/images/academic-analysis.png)



## How It Works



![How It Works — Upload, Analyze, Review, Export](https://github.com/PlagueHO/marginalia/blob/main/docs/public/images/how-it-works.svg)



1. **Upload or Paste** — Drag-and-drop a `.docx` file or paste text directly. Marginalia splits your document into paragraphs for focused analysis.

1. **Guide & Analyze** — Write custom instructions, pick a tone (Professional, Narrative, Academic, Conversational, or Literary), and hit *Analyze*. The AI reviews your text and returns suggestions with clear rationale for each.

1. **Review & Refine** — Suggestions appear in a resizable side panel, color-coded by status. Accept, reject, or modify each one. Accepting a suggestion for a paragraph automatically rejects competing alternatives. Re-analyze individual paragraphs or the entire document at any time.

1. **Export** — Download your revised manuscript as a Word document with all accepted changes applied.



## Quick Start



For full setup instructions, see [docs/QUICKSTART-LOCAL.md](https://github.com/PlagueHO/marginalia/blob/main/docs/QUICKSTART-LOCAL.md). To deploy to Azure, see [docs/QUICKSTART-AZURE.md](https://github.com/PlagueHO/marginalia/blob/main/docs/QUICKSTART-AZURE.md).



### Prerequisites



- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)

- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

- [.NET Aspire workload](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/) — `dotnet workload install aspire`

- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) with an Azure account (free tier works)



### Run Locally



```bash

git clone https://github.com/PlagueHO/marginalia.git

cd marginalia

az login

aspire run

```



Aspire provisions a local Cosmos DB emulator and connects to your AI Foundry endpoint, then starts the backend API and Vite dev server. Open <http://localhost:5173> to begin editing.



For troubleshooting, credential configuration, and model overrides, see [Local Development](https://github.com/PlagueHO/marginalia/blob/main/docs/QUICKSTART-LOCAL.md).

## Features



### Editorial Intelligence



- **Paragraph-level AI analysis** powered by Azure AI Foundry — identifies compressed narrative, stylistic drift, repetitive structures, and expansion opportunities.

- **Transparent rationale** — every suggestion explains *why*, not just *what*.

- **Tone guidance** — five built-in tone profiles plus free-form written instructions.

- **Iterative refinement** — re-analyze individual paragraphs with surrounding context, or the full document with accepted edits merged in.



### Writer-First Workflow



- **Accept / Reject / Modify** — full control over every suggestion. Modify lets you steer the AI's output with your own text.

- **Exclusive acceptance** — accepting one suggestion for a paragraph auto-rejects the others, keeping your decisions clean.

- **Batch actions** — bulk accept or reject suggestions by status filter.

- **Document management** — rename, delete, and browse all your documents from the home page.



### Polished Experience



- **Resizable split layout** — drag the divider between the editor and suggestion panel to suit your screen.

- **Dark and light themes** — toggle in the header; persists across sessions.

- **Status-coded highlights** — amber (pending), emerald (accepted), rose (rejected), sky (modified) in both the editor and suggestion cards.

- **Word import & export** — upload `.docx`, export `*-revised.docx` with formatting preserved.

- **Accessibility** — jest-axe tested components, color + icon status indicators (never color-only).



### Built for Flexibility



- **Bring Your Own Model** — configure any compatible Foundry endpoint and model, or use Entra ID authentication.

- **Access code protection** — optionally gate the app behind an access code for single-user deployments.

- **LLM health check** — verify your AI endpoint connection from the settings dialog.

- **OpenTelemetry** — full observability for both frontend and backend via .NET Aspire.

<summary><strong>Specification</strong> — Full technical requirements and data model.</summary>



## Specification



### Functional Requirements



#### Document Ingestion & Management



- Upload Microsoft Word documents (`.docx`, up to 50 MB) from the local machine.

- Paste text directly into the editor as an alternative to file upload.

- Split documents into paragraphs for focused, paragraph-level analysis.

- Rename and delete documents from the home page.



#### Guidance & Control



- Let the author specify areas for improvement (e.g., compressed narrative, AI-like writing, lack of color).

- Enable authors to provide custom written instructions per analysis run.

- Present the option to choose a desired tone (Professional, Narrative, Academic, Conversational, Literary) or provide free-form guidance.



#### Suggestion Engine



- Analyze the given text paragraph by paragraph, highlighting passages where:

  - The narrative may be overly compressed.

  - Style is inconsistent or "AI-like."

  - Repetitive or awkward prosaic structures are found.

  - Additional narrative detail or expansion could be beneficial.

- Provide AI-generated suggestions with rationale for each.

- Allow batch or individual acceptance/rejection of suggestions.

- Enable users to modify or further steer the AI's suggestions before applying.

- Accepting a suggestion for a paragraph auto-rejects competing alternatives.

- Re-analyze individual paragraphs (with surrounding context) or the full document with accepted edits merged in.



#### User Interface



- Display text with visually distinct, color-coded highlights for suggested areas (amber, emerald, rose, sky).

- Show suggestion rationale in a resizable side panel.

- Filter suggestions by status (All, Pending, Accepted, Rejected, Modified).

- Dark and light theme toggle with persistent preference.

- Apply selected changes to the document, maintaining original formatting where possible.



#### Export & Save



- Export revised document locally as a Word file (`.docx`) with accepted suggestions applied.

- Google Docs import/export (planned — not yet implemented).



### Non-Functional Requirements



- Optional access code protection for single-user deployments.

- Reliable file handling for local document imports/exports.

- Responsive and user-friendly interface.

- Accessible UI tested with jest-axe; status indicators use color + icon.

- Full OpenTelemetry observability for frontend and backend.



### Tech Stack



- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, TypeScript (strict mode), Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui (New York style), Lucide icons

- **Backend**: .NET 10, ASP.NET Core Web API, Clean Architecture

- **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB with `/userId` partition key (multi-tenant by user)

- **AI**: Azure AI Foundry via Microsoft.Extensions.AI `IChatClient`, configurable model endpoint

- **Infrastructure**: Azure Bicep, .NET Aspire orchestration, Azure Developer CLI



### Architecture Overview



#### Client-Server Model



- React frontend for UI, text highlighting, and direct user interaction.

- Backend APIs handle file uploads, document parsing, session management, and AI orchestration.

- Integration with Azure AI Foundry for text analysis and suggestion generation.

- Cosmos DB persistence for documents and sessions, partitioned by user.

- .NET Aspire manages local development and cloud orchestration.



#### Backend Structure (Clean Architecture)



- `Domain/` — Core models (Document, Paragraph, Suggestion, UserSession), interfaces, and enums with zero external dependencies.

- `Api/` — ASP.NET Core endpoints for file uploads, document analysis, suggestion management, and configuration.

- `Infrastructure/` — Service implementations for Word document processing, AI integration, and Cosmos DB repositories.

- Shared build configuration via `Directory.Build.props` and `Directory.Packages.props`.



#### Frontend Structure



- `src/components/` — UI components organized by domain (document editor, suggestion panel, upload, export).

- `src/hooks/` — Custom hooks for state management (`useDocument`, `useSuggestions`, `useAnalysis`, `useLlmConfig`, `useTheme`, `useAccessCode`).

- `src/services/` — Typed API client layer with centralized error handling.

- `src/types/` — TypeScript type definitions mirroring backend models.



### Data Model



#### Document



- `id` — Unique identifier

- `userId` — Owner identifier (from `X-User-Id` header)

- `filename` — Original filename

- `title` — Editable document title

- `source` — Origin (Local or GoogleDocs)

- `status` — Draft or Analyzed

- `paragraphs[]` — Array of paragraph objects with id and text

- `suggestions[]` — Array of associated suggestions



#### Suggestion



- `id` — Unique identifier

- `documentId` — Foreign key to Document

- `paragraphId` — Foreign key to paragraph within the document

- `rationale` — Explanation for the suggestion

- `proposedChange` — Suggested replacement text

- `status` — Pending, Accepted, Rejected, or Modified

- `userSteeringInput` — Author's custom feedback or modified text



#### UserSession



- `id` — Unique identifier

- `userId` — Owner identifier

- `documentIds[]` — Documents opened in this session

- `createdAt` / `updatedAt` — Timestamps



### External Integrations



- **Azure AI Foundry** — For AI-powered text analysis and suggestion generation. Supports Entra ID or API key authentication.

- **Google Docs API** — Planned for importing/exporting documents (not yet implemented).

- **OpenXML SDK** — For Word document parsing and export with formatting preservation.



### Constraints & Assumptions



- Maximum document chunk size is approximately 3 pages (~6,000 characters) per analysis to maintain responsiveness.

- Minimal authentication — BYO model pattern via LLM endpoint configuration; optional access code.

- Internet connection required for AI processing.

- Original formatting and footnotes use best-effort preservation.

- Designed for English-language manuscripts.

- Accepted suggestions are merged into paragraph text during re-analysis to preserve edits.
