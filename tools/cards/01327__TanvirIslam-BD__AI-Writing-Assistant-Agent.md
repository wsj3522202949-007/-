# AI Writing Assistant Agent

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent AI Writing Assistant using LangGraph architecture. The system features a smart agent that automatically analyzes text and decides which writing improvement tools to apply based on the content's specific needs.

### 🎯 Key Features
- **Intelligent Tool Selection**: LLM-powered agent decides which tools to use
- **Multi-Step Processing**: Iterative improvement through tool chaining
- **Web Interface**: Django-based user-friendly interface
- **Analysis-Driven**: Text analysis guides tool selection decisions
- **Flexible Architecture**: Supports both LLM and direct tool modes

## 🛠️ Writing Tools Description

### 1. **Grammar Correction Tool**
- **Purpose**: Fixes grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors
- **When Used**: Detected grammar issues, missing punctuation, spelling errors
- **Examples**:
  - `their going` → `they're going`
  - `its going` → `it's going`
  - Missing periods at sentence endings

### 2. **Sentence Rewriting Tool**
- **Purpose**: Improves sentence structure and clarity
- **When Used**: Complex sentences, wordy phrases, unclear structure
- **Examples**:
  - `due to the fact that` → `because`
  - `in order to` → `to`
  - `at this point in time` → `now`

### 3. **Vocabulary Enhancement Tool**
- **Purpose**: Replaces basic words with sophisticated alternatives
- **When Used**: High percentage of basic vocabulary detected
- **Examples**:
  - `good` → `excellent`
  - `bad` → `poor`
  - `big` → `substantial`
  - `very` → `extremely`

### 4. **Tone Adjustment Tool**
- **Purpose**: Adjusts writing tone for different contexts
- **When Used**: User specifies tone or agent determines inappropriate tone
- **Supported Tones**:
  - **Formal**: `okay` → `acceptable`
  - **Casual**: `utilize` → `use`
  - **Professional**: `totally` → `completely`
  - **Friendly**: `demand` → `ask for`

### 5. **Text Analysis Tool**
- **Purpose**: Analyzes text to determine improvement opportunities
- **When Used**: Always runs first to guide other tool selection
- **Output**: Recommended tools, priority order, analysis metrics

## 🧠 Agent Decision-Making Process

### **1. Analysis Phase**
```python
def _analyze_text(self, state: WritingState) -> WritingState:
    # Analyze input text using text_analysis_tool
    analysis_result = text_analysis_tool.invoke({"text": original_text})

    # Extract recommended tools based on:
    # - Grammar issues detected
    # - Sentence complexity
    # - Vocabulary sophistication level
    # - Current tone assessment
```

### **2. LLM Decision Phase**
```python
def _agent_node(self, state: WritingState) -> WritingState:
    # LLM receives:
    # - Text analysis results
    # - Recommended tools list
    # - Current text state

    # LLM decides:
    # - Which tools to call
    # - In what order
    # - Whether more tools are needed
```

### **3. Decision Criteria**

| Condition | Tools Selected | Priority |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Grammar issues detected | Grammar Correction | High |
| Sentences >25 words | Sentence Rewriting | Medium |
| >10% basic vocabulary | Vocabulary Enhancement | Medium |
| User specifies tone | Tone Adjustment | User-driven |
| Multiple issues | Sequential application | Analysis-driven |

### **4. Flow Control Logic**
```python
# Conditional routing based on LLM decision
graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "agent",
    tools_condition,  # Checks if LLM wants to call tools
    {
        "tools": "tools",      # Route to tool execution
        "__end__": "finalizer" # Route to completion
    }
)
```

## 💻 Implementation Architecture

### **State Management**
```python
class WritingState(TypedDict):
    """Shared state across all graph nodes"""
    messages: Annotated[List, add_messages]  # Message history
    original_text: str                       # User input
    current_text: str                       # Working text
    analysis_results: Dict                  # Analysis output
    improvements_made: List[Dict]           # Applied tools
    processing_complete: bool               # Workflow status
```

### **Graph Structure**
```python
def _build_graph(self) -> StateGraph:
    graph_builder = StateGraph(WritingState)

    # Add processing nodes
    graph_builder.add_node("analyzer", self._analyze_text)
    graph_builder.add_node("agent", self._agent_node)
    graph_builder.add_node("tools", ToolNode(WRITING_TOOLS))
    graph_builder.add_node("finalizer", self._finalize_response)

    # Define workflow edges
    graph_builder.add_edge(START, "analyzer")
    graph_builder.add_edge("analyzer", "agent")
    graph_builder.add_conditional_edges("agent", tools_condition, {...})
    graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "agent")  # Iterative loop
    graph_builder.add_edge("finalizer", END)

    return graph_builder.compile()
```

### **Tool Integration**
```python
# LangChain tool decoration
@tool
def grammar_correction_tool(text: str) -> str:
    """Fixes grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors"""
    result = text
    for pattern, replacement in GRAMMAR_PATTERNS.items():
        result = re.sub(pattern, replacement, result, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    return result.strip()

# Bind tools to LLM for intelligent calling
self.llm_with_tools = self.llm.bind_tools(WRITING_TOOLS)
```

## 🎬 Demo Example

### **Input Text**
```
"this is a very bad text with bad grammar and it have many issue that need to be fix"
```

### **Step-by-Step Processing**

#### **1. Analysis Phase**
```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "grammar": {"issues_found": 3},
    "sentence": {"complex_sentences": 0},
    "vocabulary": {"basic_words": 4},
    "tone": {"current_tone": "neutral"}
  },
  "recommended_tools": [
    "grammar_correction_tool",
    "vocabulary_enhancement_tool",
    "tone_adjustment_tool"
  ],
  "priority_order": ["grammar_correction_tool", "vocabulary_enhancement_tool"]
}
```

#### **2. Agent Decision**
LLM receives analysis and decides to apply recommended tools in sequence.

#### **3. Tool Execution Sequence**

**Grammar Correction Applied:**
```
Before: "this is a very bad text with bad grammar and it have many issue that need to be fix"
After:  "This is a very bad text with bad grammar and it has many issues that need to be fixed."
```

**Vocabulary Enhancement Applied:**
```
Before: "This is a very bad text with bad grammar and it has many issues that need to be fixed."
After:  "This is a remarkably poor text with poor grammar and it has many issues that need to be fixed."
```

**Tone Adjustment Applied:**
```
Before: "This is a remarkably poor text with poor grammar and it has many issues that need to be fixed."
After:  "This is a remarkably substandard text with poor grammar and it has many issues that need to be fixed."
```

#### **4. Final Output**
```json
{
  "original": "this is a very bad text with bad grammar and it have many issue that need to be fix",
  "improved": "This is a remarkably substandard text with poor grammar and it has many issues that need to be fixed.",
  "success": true,
  "tools_used": [
    "grammar_correction_tool",
    "vocabulary_enhancement_tool",
    "tone_adjustment_tool"
  ],
  "improvements": [
    {
      "tool": "grammar_correction_tool",
      "changes": ["Capitalization", "have→has", "issue→issues", "fix→fixed"]
    },
    {
      "tool": "vocabulary_enhancement_tool",
      "changes": ["very→remarkably", "bad→poor"]
    },
    {
      "tool": "tone_adjustment_tool",
      "changes": ["bad→substandard"]
    }
  ],
  "processing_time": 2.34
}
```
