## Introduction

**nflow is an AI-powered novel writing pipeline engine.**

> **It treats fiction writing as an engineering problem, not a chat session.**

Unlike traditional AI writing assistants that rely on chat-based interactions, nflow provides a structured, engineering approach to long-form fiction creation. It combines multi-agent collaboration with a triple self-review mechanism to solve the core problem of AI-generated long texts: **instability and inconsistency**.

### The Real Problem It Solves

Most AI writing tools share one fundamental limitation:

> **They can write, but they can't keep writing consistently.**

Common manifestations:
- Character personalities drift after 3-5 chapters
- Previous settings are forgotten or contradict themselves
- Plot progresses by random inspiration rather than long-term planning
- Long-form quality is completely uncontrollable, requiring constant rewriting

**nflow is positioned exactly on this pain point:** It doesn't pursue "instant inspiration" but aims for **sustained, controllable, and reusable long-text production**.

### Core Philosophy

- **🏭 Writing as Engineering**: Break creation into executable steps, not just a pile of prompts
- **🔄 Multi-Agent + Triple Review**: Not "write and done", but "write → check → fix → recheck"
- **🎛️ Control Over Speed**: Prioritize quality and controllability over instant gratification
- **🛠️ CLI + Templates + Generators**: Reuse writing methods like code, not start from scratch each time

## nflow vs Other AI Writing Tools

### nflow vs ChatGPT / Claude (General Chat-based AI)

| Dimension | ChatGPT / Claude | nflow |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Usage | Conversation | CLI + Pipeline |
| Writing Model | Single model impromptu | Multi-Agent Collaboration |
| Long-form Consistency | Low, relies on human memory | High, relies on structure and review |
| Writing Process | None | Clear stages (Outline → Chapter → Review) |
| Control | Weak | Strong |
| Target Audience | Temporary writing, short texts | Systematic novel writers |

**One-sentence evaluation:** **ChatGPT is "someone who can write", nflow is "a writing factory".**

---

### nflow vs Commercial AI Novel Platforms (Sudowrite, NovelAI, etc.)

| Dimension | Commercial AI Novel Platforms | nflow |
|-----------|------------------------------|-------|
| Product Form | Web UI | CLI |
| Usage Barrier | Low | Medium |
| Customizability | Limited | Extremely High |
| Writing Logic | Feature stacking | Process-driven |
| Long-form Stability | Medium | High |
| Openness | Closed Source | Open Source |
| Target Audience | General creators | Heavy creators / Technical writers |

**One-sentence evaluation:** **Commercial platforms sell "experience", nflow sells "control".**

---

### nflow vs One-Click Book Generation Tools

| Dimension | One-Click Tools | nflow |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Writing Quality | Unstable | Controllable |
| Modifiability | Poor | Strong |
| Author Participation | Minimal | High |
| Result Maintainability | Almost none | Complete structure |
| Practicality | Gimmick | Practical |

**One-sentence evaluation:** **One-click tools are lottery tickets, nflow is a production line.**

---

## Who Is nflow For?

nflow **is not for everyone**, which is actually its strength.

### Perfect For:

- People who want to write **100,000+ words** novels
- People obsessed with AI output **controllability**
- People willing to sacrifice some instant gratification for quality
- Technical background authors / Open source writers
- People who treat writing as a long-term project, not a toy

### Not Recommended For:

- People looking for "write a novel with one click"
- People who prefer visual UI over command line
- People writing short stories (under 50,000 words)
- People who want completely hands-off AI writing

## Core Features

### nflow's Unique Moat

Not just "AI novel writing", but the combination of these three points:

1. **Writing Process Engineering**
   Break creation into executable steps, not just a pile of prompts.

2. **Multi-Agent + Triple Self-Review**
   Not "write and done", but **write → check → fix → recheck**.

3. **CLI + Templates + Generator System**
   Reuse writing methods like code, not start from scratch each time.

These three points together make it **irreplaceable**.

### 🎯 Triple Self-Review Mechanism

**Pre-writing - Context Injection**
- Inject complete outline, chapter planning
- Inject character profiles, world-building settings
- Inject completed chapter summaries, current plot state
- Inject foreshadowing list, timeline, character relationship map

**During Writing - Real-time Checks**
- Real-time check character consistency
- Real-time check plot logic
- Real-time check world-building settings
- Real-time check timeline
- Real-time check foreshadowing

**Post-writing - Comprehensive Review**
- Review overall structure
- Review character development
- Review plot progression
- Review writing quality
- Review consistency
- Review foreshadowing callbacks

### 📏 Word Count Control System

**Based on Tomato Novel Platform Requirements**

| Platform Requirement | nflow Setting |
|---------|----------------|
| Recommended per chapter: 2050-2300 words | **Word count range: 2000-2500 words** |
| Beneficial for audiobooks | **Target word count: 2200 words** |
| Publication range: 2000-6000 words | **Allowed error: 2000-2400 words** |

**Core Functions**

- **Smart word count setting**: Set target word count when creating project (default 2200 words)
- **Real-time word count monitoring**: Real-time statistics during writing with visual display
- **Automatic word count adjustment**:
  - Insufficient word count (<2000): Automatically expand environmental descriptions, psychological descriptions, dialogue
  - Excessive word count (>2400): Automatically compress redundant content, merge similar paragraphs
- **Word count report generation**: Per-chapter word count statistics, full-book word count distribution chart, word count achievement rate

**Usage Example**

```bash
# Set chapter word count
> config set word-count.target 2200

# Check current chapter word count
> word-count check
Current chapter: 1234 words (target 2200 words, short by 966 words)

# Auto-expand to target word count
> word-count expand
Expanded to 2210 words

# View full-book word count distribution
> word-count report
```

### 🔄 Quality Control Loop

**"Review → Setting Check → Continue Writing" Loop Mechanism**

```
Generate Chapter → Word Count Check → Quality Review → Setting Check → Auto Fix → Polish → Score → Save/Rewrite
```

**Quality Review Dimensions**

| Dimension | Check Content | Weight |
|------|---------|------|
| **Character Consistency** | Whether character personality, language, behavior match settings | 30% |
| **Plot Logic** | Whether plot development is reasonable, no plot holes | 25% |
| **World-building Settings** | Whether violates world-building rules | 20% |
| **Timeline** | Whether chronological order is correct | 15% |
| **Foreshadowing Callbacks** | Whether foreshadowing is callback | 10% |

**Quality Scoring System**

- **90+**: Excellent, can be published directly
- **80-89**: Good, can continue
- **70-79**: Average, recommended to optimize
- **60-69**: Pass, needs modification
- **Below 60**: Fail, must rewrite

**Usage Example**

```bash
# Quality review current chapter
> review
Quality score: 75 points
- Character consistency: 80 points ✓
- Plot logic: 70 points ⚠ (2 logic holes)
- World-building settings: 85 points ✓
- Timeline: 65 points ⚠ (timeline error)
- Foreshadowing callbacks: 70 points ⚠ (foreshadowing not callback)

# Auto fix
> review auto-fix
Auto fixed:
✓ Fixed timeline error
✓ Fixed logic holes
✓ Callback foreshadowing

# Re-review
> review
Quality score: 88 points (+13 points)✓
```

### 🔧 Auto-Fix Mechanism

**Auto-detect and fix common issues**

| Issue Type | Detection Method | Fix Strategy |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Insufficient word count** | Word count statistics | Auto-expand content |
| **Excessive word count** | Word count statistics | Auto-compress content |
| **Character OOC** | Personality consistency check | Adjust character behavior |
| **Timeline error** | Timeline check | Fix chronological order |
| **Setting conflict** | Setting consistency check | Adjust setting description |
| **Missing foreshadowing** | Foreshadowing check | Add foreshadowing callback |

**Auto-fix Configuration**

```bash
# View auto-fix configuration
> auto-fix config
Status: ✓ Enabled
Fix level: moderate
Auto-fix types:
  ✓ word_count_insufficient
  ✓ word_count_excess
  ✓ character_ooc_mild
  ✓ timeline_error_simple
  ✓ setting_conflict_minor
Manual confirmation types:
  ✓ character_ooc_severe
  ✓ timeline_error_complex
  ✓ setting_conflict_major
  ✓ foreshadowing_missed_critical

# Adjust fix level
> auto-fix set-level aggressive
```

**Usage Example**

```bash
# Auto-fix current chapter
> auto-fix
Found 5 issues:
1. Insufficient word count (1850 words) → Expanding...
2. Character OOC (mild) → Fixing...
3. Timeline error (simple) → Fixing...
4. Setting conflict (minor) → Fixing...
5. Excessive word count (after fix 2450 words) → Compressing...

Fix complete!
- Word count: 1850 → 2215 words
- Character consistency: Fixed
- Timeline: Fixed
- Setting conflict: Resolved
- Final word count: 2215 words ✓
```

## Feature Details

### Triple Self-Review Mechanism Details

#### 1. Pre-writing - Context Injection

Before starting to write, nflow automatically injects complete context information to ensure AI has sufficient information foundation:

```typescript
type FullContext = {
  fullOutline: string;           // Complete outline
  chapterPlan: string;           // Chapter planning
  basicSettings: string;         // Basic settings
  characterProfiles: string;     // Character profiles
  worldSettings: string;         // World-building settings
  completedChaptersSummary: string;  // Completed chapter summaries
  currentPlotState: string;      // Current plot state
  foreshadowings: string;        // Foreshadowing list
  timeline: string;              // Timeline
  characterRelationships: string; // Character relationships
};
```

#### 2. During Writing - Real-time Checks

During the writing process, nflow real-time checks each paragraph:

```typescript
async checkWhileWriting(segment: string, context: FullContext): Promise<CheckResult> {
  const checks = await Promise.all([
    this.checkCharacterConsistency(segment, context),  // Character consistency
    this.checkPlotLogic(segment, context),             // Plot logic
    this.checkWorldSetting(segment, context),          // World-building settings
    this.checkTimeline(segment, context),              // Timeline
    this.checkForeshadowing(segment, context)          // Foreshadowing check
  ]);
  
  return this.aggregateChecks(checks);
}
```

#### 3. Post-writing - Comprehensive Review

After writing is complete, conduct comprehensive review:

```typescript
async fullReview(chapter: string, context: FullContext): Promise<FullReviewResult> {
  const review = await Promise.all([
    this.reviewOverallStructure(chapter, context),      // Overall structure
    this.reviewCharacterDevelopment(chapter, context),  // Character development
    this.reviewPlotProgression(chapter, context),       // Plot progression
    this.reviewWritingQuality(chapter, context),        // Writing quality
    this.reviewConsistency(chapter, context),           // Consistency review
    this.reviewForeshadowing(chapter, context)          // Foreshadowing callbacks
  ]);
  
  return this.aggregateReview(review);
}
```

### Agent Model Selection

Different agents select different models based on capability requirements:

| Agent | Primary Model | Backup Model | Free Model | Reason |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|------|
| outline-agent | Claude Opus | Claude Sonnet | Kimi-K2 | Needs strong planning ability |
| character-agent | Claude Opus | Claude Sonnet | GLM-4.6 | Needs strong creativity |
| scene-agent | Claude Sonnet | GPT-4.5 | DeepSeek-v3 | Balance creativity and efficiency |
| writing-agent | Claude Sonnet | Claude Opus | Qwen3-Coder | Balance quality and efficiency |
| polish-agent | Claude Sonnet | GPT-4.5 | DeepSeek-v3 | Needs language optimization ability |
| review-agent | GPT-4.5 | Claude Sonnet | Qwen3-Coder | Needs logical reasoning ability |

### Memory Management System

nflow inherits iflow's memory compression technology, efficiently handling long-form memory:

- **Auto-summary**: Automatically compress completed chapters into summaries
- **Smart retrieval**: Automatically retrieve relevant information based on context
- **Memory compression**: Use advanced compression algorithms to reduce token consumption
- **Layered storage**: Divide memory into core information, important information, secondary information
