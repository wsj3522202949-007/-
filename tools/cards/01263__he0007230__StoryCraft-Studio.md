## 🤔 Why StoryCraft Studio?

In a world of generic text editors and bloated writing software, StoryCraft Studio carves its own niche by focusing on a holistic, AI-augmented narrative design process.

- **✍️ From Macro to Micro:** Most tools focus only on writing. We cover the _entire_ creative lifecycle — from high-level plot structure and world-building down to sentence-by-sentence prose refinement.
- **🧠 Intelligent Partnership:** The AI is not a ghostwriter — it's a Socratic partner, a tireless brainstormer, and a creative muse. It's designed to break blocks and expand your own potential, not replace it.
- **🔒 Ultimate Privacy & Ownership:** Your story is your most valuable asset. A 100% local, offline-first architecture with IndexedDB means your data never leaves your machine. No clouds, no accounts, no compromises.
- **🔬 Built-in Quality Tools:** Go beyond writing with the AI Critic, Plot-Hole Detector, and RAG Consistency Checker — tools that help you catch narrative weaknesses before your readers do.

## 🚀 Features: A Comprehensive Creative Suite

### 📊 Dynamic Project Dashboard

Your mission control. Track word counts against custom goals, visualize project statistics, manage your title and logline with AI assistance, and access all views from a single hub.

### ✍️ Three-Panel Manuscript Editor

A focused, distraction-free writing environment. The central editor is flanked by a draggable chapter **Navigator** and a project **Inspector**. An advanced overlay provides real-time highlighting and linking for `@character` and `#world` mentions, turning your manuscript into a living document.

### 🎬 Scene Board _(Visual Story Planning)_

A kanban-style drag-and-drop board for visual story planning. Organize your scenes across custom lanes, see your plot structure at a glance, and rearrange sections to check pacing and narrative flow without touching the manuscript.

### 🕸️ Character Relationship Graph _(Interactive Visualization)_

An interactive, force-directed graph that visualizes all relationships between your characters. See at a glance who knows whom, who is in conflict, and how your cast interconnects — invaluable for complex multi-POV narratives.

### 📚 Intelligent Story Template Library

Jumpstart your creativity with a library of classic structures (Three-Act, Hero's Journey, Save the Cat! Beat Sheet, Fichtean Curve) and genre templates (Fantasy, Thriller, Horror, Romance, Space Opera, and more). **Remix any template** by dragging, editing, or adding sections. **Personalize with AI** to generate chapter-specific prompts based on your unique concept.

### 🤖 AI Outline Generator

The ultimate cure for the blank page. Provide a concept and let the AI architect a detailed, chapter-by-chapter outline. Advanced controls let you specify genre, pacing, key characters, setting, and even mandate a specific plot twist. The result is a fully interactive, editable structure you can apply to your manuscript with one click.

### 👥 Advanced Character Dossiers

Breathe life into your cast. Use the **AI Profile Generator** to create compelling backstories, motivations, and personality traits from a single concept. Generate a unique **AI character portrait** in a choice of styles (realistic, anime, cartoon, comic book). Manage relationships and character arcs with dedicated fields.

### 🌍 Expansive World-Building Atlas

Construct the universe of your story. Define your world's history and lore, create interactive timelines and location lists, and let the **AI World Generation** feature write rich, consistent world-building content. Generate an atmospheric **ambiance image** to capture your world's visual identity.

### ✨ AI Writing Studio _(10 Specialized AI Tools)_

Your tireless creative co-pilot, available at every stage:

| Tool                      | What it does                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Continue Writing**      | Seamlessly continues from your last sentence in your voice                 |
| **Improve Writing**       | Rewrites selected prose for clarity, flow, and impact                      |
| **Change Tone**           | Shifts the register of any passage (darker, funnier, more formal, …)       |
| **Generate Dialogue**     | Creates authentic, in-character conversations                              |
| **Brainstorm Ideas**      | Generates creative plot possibilities for what comes next                  |
| **Generate Synopsis**     | Creates a concise, polished summary of any section                         |
| **Grammar & Style Check** | Catches errors and suggests stylistic improvements                         |
| **AI Critic**             | Delivers an honest, structured literary critique of your prose             |
| **Plot-Hole Detector**    | Analyzes your manuscript for logical inconsistencies and continuity errors |
| **Consistency Checker**   | Cross-references your text against your character and world data via RAG   |

### 🔍 RAG Consistency Checker _(Advanced)_

A dedicated view using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to give the AI deep, contextualized knowledge of your _entire_ project. It cross-checks your manuscript against character profiles and world-building notes to surface subtle inconsistencies and continuity errors that a read-through would miss.

### 🗣️ Voice Dictation

Built-in speech-to-text via the browser's Web Speech API. Dictate scenes hands-free directly into the manuscript editor.

### ⌨️ Command Palette

A keyboard-first command palette (⌘K / Ctrl+K) for instant navigation, AI actions, and project management — all without leaving the keyboard.

### 🎨 Highly Customizable Workspace

- **Dark / Light** themes
- Adjustable **font family, size, line height**, and **paragraph spacing**
- **Indent first line** toggle for traditional novel formatting
- Tunable **AI Creativity Level** (Focused → Balanced → Imaginative)
- Full **Accessibility settings** (high contrast, reduced motion, color-blind modes)

### 💾 Robust Offline-First Data Management

- **Auto-save** to IndexedDB on every change (debounced, non-blocking)
- **Snapshot system** — automatic and manual project backups, restorable to any point
- **Import / Export** project files as JSON backups
- **Undo / Redo** with a 100-step history (Redux-Undo)

### 📤 Polished Export Suite

- **Markdown** (`.md`), **Plain Text** (`.txt`), **PDF** (with titlepage, configurable font and spacing)
- **AI Synopsis** — generate a one-page synopsis before exporting
- Selective content inclusion (title & logline, characters, worlds, manuscript)

### 📱 Progressive Web App (PWA) v3.0

- **Offline-first** — all assets cached via Service Worker
- **Installable** on desktop and mobile (iOS & Android)
- **App shortcuts** for quick access from the home screen icon
- Update notifications and background sync support

### 🤝 Real-Time Collaboration Resilience

- Collaboration uses Yjs + y-webrtc with multiple signaling endpoints for failover.
- Default signaling endpoints: `wss://y-webrtc-signaling.fly.dev`, `wss://signaling.yjs.dev`.
- Room IDs are derived from a hash, but signaling operators can still observe connection metadata (timing and room identifier traffic patterns).

For production or sensitive collaboration environments, host your own signaling server.

#### Self-host signaling (Cloudflare Worker)

1. Deploy a y-webrtc-compatible signaling worker using an established open-source recipe.
2. Add your endpoint to `SIGNALING_SERVERS` in `services/collaborationService.ts`.
3. Allow your endpoint in the CSP `connect-src` directive in `index.html`.
4. Keep at least one fallback endpoint during migration to avoid downtime.

### 🌐 Full Multi-Language Support

Fully localized to:

- 🇩🇪 **German** (Deutsch) — complete
- 🇬🇧 **English** — complete
- 🇫🇷 French, 🇪🇸 Spanish, 🇮🇹 Italian _(in progress)_

Language selection persists across sessions via `localStorage`.

## 💡 Our Philosophy

- **Privacy First** — All data stays local. No accounts, no cloud, no tracking.
- **AI as a Partner, Not a Replacement** — The AI augments your creativity; you remain the author.
- **Seamless Workflow** — Tools that get out of the way and keep you in your creative flow.
- **Quality Over Quantity** — Each AI tool has a single, specific purpose crafted for a real creative need.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

A modern browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+) is all you need — no installation required.

### 🔐 Setting Up Your Gemini API Key

All AI features require a free Google Gemini API key.

1. **Get your key** at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) — it's free
2. **Open Settings** in the app (gear icon in the sidebar)
3. **Enter your API key** under "Gemini API Key"
4. **Click Save** — the key is encrypted with AES-256-GCM and stored only in your browser's IndexedDB

**Security best practices:**

- ✅ Your key never leaves your device
- ✅ Encrypted at rest via the Web Crypto API
- ✅ No key is ever stored in source code or build artifacts
- 🔒 **Recommended:** Restrict your key to `*.github.io` in Google AI Studio

### 🚀 Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Enable GitHub Pages:** Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**
3. **Push to `main`** — deployment runs automatically via GitHub Actions
4. **Access your app** at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/StoryCraft-Studio/`

### 💻 Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/qnbs/StoryCraft-Studio.git
cd StoryCraft-Studio

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server (http://localhost:3000)
pnpm run dev

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Preview the production build locally
pnpm run preview
```

> Note: The production build uses Vite manual chunking and lazy-loaded export libraries (`docx` / `jszip`) to keep the main app bundle smaller and improve load performance.

### 🧪 CI & Local Validation

This repository uses an optimized GitHub Actions pipeline that includes:

- `lint` + `typecheck`
- `test` with Vitest coverage and JUnit reporting
- `storybook` build artifact generation
- `security` dependency-review with `pnpm audit` on dependency changes
- `build` for production, plus optional `build-node` compatibility on tags and manual dispatch
- `lighthouse` budget validation
- `deploy` to GitHub Pages on `main`

You can simulate the pipeline locally using [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

```bash
# Install Act (requires Docker)
npm install -g act

# Run the CI workflow locally for pull request simulation
act pull_request --job lint --job typecheck --job test --job storybook --job build

# Run the full CI workflow locally for a tag/dispatch build
act push --job build --job build-node --job lighthouse --job deploy
```

If you use Codecov locally, provide the token with `-s CODECOV_TOKEN=<token>`. For faster local runs, you can skip external upload steps by using `--secret-file .github/act.secrets` or disabling `CODECOV_TOKEN`.

### 🌐 Custom Domain Setup

1. Create a `CNAME` file in `public/` with your domain:

   ```bash
   echo "storycraft.yourdomain.com" > public/CNAME
   ```

2. Configure DNS at your registrar:
   - **Subdomain** → CNAME → `your-username.github.io`
   - **Apex domain** → A records to `185.199.108.153` – `185.199.111.153`
3. Push changes — the build auto-detects `CNAME` and switches the base path to `/`
4. Enable HTTPS in GitHub Pages settings

### 🛠 Troubleshooting

| Problem                   | Solution                                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blank page after deploy   | Verify `base` in `vite.config.ts` matches your repo name              |
| Assets not loading (404)  | Check `manifest.json` `start_url`; verify `404.html` is in `public/`  |
| AI features not working   | Check API key in Settings; verify it starts with `AIza` and has quota |
| Language resets on reload | Clear site data and re-select — should now persist via `localStorage` |

## 🚀 A Creative Workflow

1. **Conceive** — Start in the **Welcome Portal** with a Template, the AI Outline Generator, or a blank manuscript.
2. **Build** — Create **Characters** and **Worlds** with AI. Visualize your cast in the **Character Relationship Graph**.
3. **Structure** — Refine your plot in the **Outline Generator** or arrange scenes visually on the **Scene Board**.
4. **Write** — Immerse yourself in the **Manuscript** editor. `@mentions` link characters and worlds. Progress is saved automatically.
5. **Enhance** — Use the **AI Writing Studio** to continue, improve, generate dialogue, or brainstorm.
6. **Review** — Run the **AI Critic** for literary feedback, the **Plot-Hole Detector** for logic issues, and the **Consistency Checker** for continuity.
7. **Snapshot** — Save a project version in Settings before major revisions. Restore anytime.
8. **Publish** — Export as Markdown, plain text, or a formatted **PDF** with an AI-generated synopsis.
