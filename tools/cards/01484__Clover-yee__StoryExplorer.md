## Abstract
In the context of the exponentially increasing volume of narrative texts such as novels and news, readers struggle to extract and consistently remember storyline from these intricate texts due to the constraints of human working memory and attention span. To tackle this issue, we propose a visualization approach StoryExplorer, which facilitates the process of knowledge externalization of narrative texts and further makes the form of mental models more coherent. Through the formative study and close collaboration with 2 domain experts, we identified key challenges for the extraction of the storyline. Guided by the distilled requirements, we then propose a set of workflow (i.e., insight finding-scripting-storytelling) to enable users to interactively generate fragments of narrative structures. We then propose a visualization system StoryExplorer which combines stroke annotation and GPT-based visual hints to quickly extract story fragments and interactively construct storyline. To evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of StoryExplorer, we conducted 2 case studies and in-depth user interviews with 16 target users. The result shows that users can better extract the storyline by using StoryExplorer along with the proposed workflow.

## Install
1. install `npm install`
2. `npm run serve` to run this application
3. `cd server-mongdb` and `node index` to run the server

## ToDo
- [ ] Improve the user interface:
    - [ ] Enable online edit mode
    - [ ] Add support panel function
- [ ] Release more cases data
- [ ] Release the system pipeline
- [ ] Better document the code

## Prompt
Note that your response should only be in JSON format; there is no need to add any statements. I want you to play the role of a data analyst expert who excels at extracting named entities from text. Your reasoning process should be step-by-step, with a clear confidence threshold mechanism. Your workflow should include the following:

1. I will provide you with text content, please read it carefully and analyze the following entity types:
   - Person Names
   - Time Expressions 
   - Location Names

2. For each identified entity, you should:
   - Extract the entity
   - Determine its category
   - Assign a confidence score (0-100)
   - Compare against the threshold value [threshold]

3. There are three confidence levels for entity extraction:
   - High confidence (score > threshold): Based on explicit textual evidence
   - Medium confidence (score = threshold): Based on contextual inference
   - Low confidence (score < threshold): Based on the model's prior knowledge

4. The output should be in the following JSON format:

  ```json
   {
     "entities": [
       {
         "text": "",
         "type": "PERSON/TIME/LOCATION",
         "confidence_score": 0-100,
         "confidence_level": "high/medium/low"
       }
     ],
     "metadata": {
       "threshold": [threshold],
       "total_entities": 0
     }
   }
```
Here is the text I need you to process: "..."
