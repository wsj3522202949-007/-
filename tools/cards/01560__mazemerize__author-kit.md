﻿![Author Kit Logo](./media/logo.png)

**Write books with structured AI assistance. Chapter by chapter. Draft by draft. Together.**

An open-source toolkit that brings structured, template-driven principles to book writing. Instead of vibe-writing an entire manuscript, Author Kit guides you through a structured workflow: define your concept, outline the structure, then iteratively plan, draft, and review each chapter — with full support for changing direction mid-process. Outline incrementally as you discover your story, brainstorm interactively, and co-write chapters scene by scene.

## What is Author Kit?

Traditional AI-assisted writing often means dumping an idea and hoping for a good result. Author Kit takes a different approach:

1. **Concept first** — Define your book's premise, themes, audience, and voice before writing a single word
2. **Incremental discovery** — Outline part of the book, draft those chapters, then extend the outline based on what emerged. Brainstorm ideas interactively before committing
3. **Outline before prose** — Create a structural outline with chapter summaries, character arcs, and thematic maps — all at once or part by part
4. **World maintenance** — Build and track your book's world (characters, places, systems, history) as a living reference
5. **Collaborative chapter writing** — Write chapters together: draft scene by scene, get help on specific paragraphs, or let the AI continue where you left off
6. **Chapter-level iteration** — Each chapter goes through its own plan-draft-review cycle, so quality is built in, not bolted on
7. **Cross-chapter consistency** — Analyze the full manuscript for continuity, pacing, and thematic coherence
8. **Mid-process flexibility** — Amend direction or facts, defer decisions, explore alternatives, and restructure without losing work
9. **Manuscript generation** — Export the fully generated content as a word or epub document
10. **Audiobook export** — Use AI to generate an audio version of your manuscript

This works for **any genre**: literary fiction, thrillers, non-fiction guides, memoirs, technical books, and everything in between.

## Get Started

Author Kit uses an installer CLI and supports **Claude Code**, **GitHub Copilot**, and **Codex**.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **uv** (`uvx` and `uv tool install`)
- **Git**
- **Linux/macOS or Windows**
- One of the following AI agents:
  - **[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)**
  - **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)**
  - **[Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)**

### 1. Set up the project

One-shot install (always latest):

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/mazemerize/author-kit.git authorkit init . --ai claude --script sh
```

Persistent PATH install:

```bash
uv tool install authorkit-cli --from git+https://github.com/mazemerize/author-kit.git
authorkit init . --ai copilot --script sh
authorkit init . --ai codex --script sh
authorkit init . --ai claude --script ps
```

Update an existing repo in-place:

```bash
authorkit init --here --force --ai codex --script sh
```

For Codex, set `CODEX_HOME` to `<repo>/.codex` after install.

### Agent tool checks

By default, `authorkit init` checks for required CLI tools for selected AI flavors:

- `claude` requires `claude` on PATH
- `codex` requires `codex` on PATH
- `copilot` does not require a dedicated binary for prompt installation

If you prefer to install prompts/files without tool checks, use `--ignore-agent-tools`:

```bash
authorkit init . --ai claude,copilot,codex --script sh --ignore-agent-tools
```

**Notes**:

- For Codex: PATH check and `CODEX_HOME` are different
  - PATH check validates the `codex` executable exists.
  - `CODEX_HOME` points Codex to the repo-local `.codex` folder after install.
- Choose `sh` (Bash) for MacOS and Linux or `ps` (PowerShell) for Windows.

> **Where to run what:** Commands beginning with `/` (e.g. `/authorkit.discuss`) are typed inside your AI agent's chat — Claude Code, Copilot, or Codex. Commands beginning with `authorkit` (no slash) run in your terminal at the project root.

### 2. Start with a conversation

`/authorkit.discuss` is the entry point for everything that isn't pure manuscript writing. On a fresh repo, it brainstorms with you and produces `concept.md` (premise, audience, voice, themes, scope) plus the `book/` workspace. On an existing repo, it clarifies ambiguities, propagates cross-cutting changes, restructures chapters, updates the constitution, and more — always read-only by default, every write proposed and confirmed first.

```bash
/authorkit.discuss A mystery novel set in a crumbling Victorian observatory where an astronomer discovers that the star catalogue compiled by the previous director contains a hidden code.
```

You can also use it to talk through specific things later:

```bash
/authorkit.discuss the magic system feels vague
/authorkit.discuss should the protagonist succeed or fail at the end?
/authorkit.discuss change Marcus from a soldier to a spy across the manuscript
/authorkit.discuss move CH05 to after CH02
/authorkit.discuss try first person POV for the flashbacks
/authorkit.discuss tighten the voice rules to favor short sentences
/authorkit.discuss park: should the villain survive the third act?
```

The model auto-detects what mode of conversation you're having — brainstorming, clarifying, amending, restructuring, what-if-ing, updating the constitution, parking a decision — and routes any decision you approve to the right file (concept, world entry, outline, characters, parked decisions, etc.). For large changes it presents an impact plan and an auto-snapshot before propagating.

### 3. Write chapters

`/authorkit.write` is the manuscript-generation command. It generates the outline and chapter list if they don't exist yet, plans the requested chapter, drafts it, and reconciles state afterwards — extracting any new world details into `world/`, refreshing the outline summary so it matches the drafted prose, updating `chapters.md` status, and rebuilding the `world/_index.md`.

```bash
/authorkit.write                # Plan + draft the next pending chapter
/authorkit.write 1              # Plan + draft chapter 1
/authorkit.write 7 interactive  # Plan, then write one scene at a time with pauses
/authorkit.write 3 scene 2      # Write just scene 2 of chapter 3
/authorkit.write 5 continue     # Continue chapter 5 from where the draft ends
/authorkit.write 4 from scene 3 # Write from scene 3 through the end
/authorkit.write 8 revise: fix the timeline contradiction with chapter 5
/authorkit.write 6 help improve the opening paragraph
/authorkit.write 6 help I'm stuck on the transition to the next scene
/authorkit.write outline part 1 # Build the structural outline for part 1 only
/authorkit.write outline extend # Extend a partial outline with the next section
```

Progress is tracked in `chapters.md` with status markers:

| Marker | Status | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending | Chapter not yet started |
| `[P]` | Planned | Chapter plan exists (`chapters/NN/plan.md`) |
| `[D]` | Drafted | First draft written (`chapters/NN/draft.md`) |
| `[R]` | Reviewed | Review completed, needs revision |
| `[X]` | Approved | Chapter passed review, ready for final manuscript |

For cross-model prose continuity, `/authorkit.write` also maintains `book/style-anchor.md`, derived from the constitution, the concept's voice & tone, plus the *earliest* approved chapters (a fixed origin, so the voice bar doesn't drift downward with recent output). Character/scene/arc *texture* is matched separately against the earliest *relevant* approved chapter, so it never lowers that bar.

Drafting itself is **conditioned on the voice rather than policed by rules**: the model writes with pages of the origin prose immediately in context (so it *continues* the book instead of following style instructions about it), sees recent before→after voice pairs from `book/voice-pairs.md`, and drafts each scene in two passes — a flat content pass (events, dialogue, concrete fact; names and numbers rolled with `authorkit entropy`) followed by a voice pass that translates it into the book's register without adding any new facts.

### 4. Review what you wrote

`/authorkit.review` does a few jobs depending on scope. Pass a chapter for a craft review (plan adherence, constitution compliance, character/world consistency, continuity, theme integration — produces `chapters/NN/review.md`); the craft review **leads with two gating passes**: style fidelity vs the fixed origin, and a **self-learning AI-tic pass** — a blind contrast of the draft against the origin prose that discovers AI-flavoured constructions (no fixed list to go stale), then reconciles them into `book/tic-ledger.md`, the book's living tic catalog with per-chapter trends. A chapter that has drifted from the book's voice, or repeats a discovered tic shape, is not approved. Pass `N style` for the **gating passes alone** (→ `chapters/NN/style-review.md`) — a fast, explicit voice check right after writing. Pass nothing (or `all` / `manuscript`) for a manuscript-wide drift sweep. Pass a range for both.

The tic defense is a loop, not a list: review **discovers** tics by contrast with the origin and remembers them in the ledger; revision fixes them and **harvests** each fix as a before→after pair into `book/voice-pairs.md`; drafting is **conditioned** on those pairs (and never sees the ledger or any tic list — pattern descriptions in a drafting context prime the very constructions they prohibit). Switch models and the ledger relearns the new model's habits within a few chapters; the shipped catalog only seeds the first entries.

```bash
/authorkit.review 1                # Craft review of chapter 1
/authorkit.review                  # Whole-manuscript drift sweep
/authorkit.review 5-10             # Craft reviews + range-scoped drift scan
```

Manuscript drift is read-only by default. If drift between drafts and upstream documents is found, you'll be offered the chance to fix it (`Fix all / Fix high-severity only / Review one by one / Skip`) — and even when approved, fixes only touch concept / outline / chapters.md / world. **Chapter drafts are never modified by `/authorkit.review`.** Use `/authorkit.write [N] revise: ...` for that.

### 5. Research grounding (optional, repeatable)

`/authorkit.research` runs grounded research from web/news/wikipedia/MCP sources and writes reusable notes.

```bash
/authorkit.research Research Victorian observatory architecture for the outline
/authorkit.research For chapter 7, research forensic botany in damp basements
/authorkit.research Research maritime signaling systems in 1890
```

Output goes to `research.md` (index) and `research/**/*.md` (topic files, flat by default, nested when a clear grouping reason exists). When findings are durable and clearly map to a `world/` category, the command **offers** world sync — gated by your approval in the chat. No silent writes to `world/`.

### 6. Export your manuscript

Export is **not** a slash command — it runs through the installer CLI directly:

```bash
authorkit book build --format docx --format epub
authorkit book audio --merge
authorkit book stats --output json
```

## The Four Commands

Author Kit's slash-command surface is **four commands** that map to authoring activities. Each one dispatches to the right mode based on what you ask for and what already exists on disk — you don't pick a sub-command, the model reads the situation.

## Autonomous Drafting (AutoPilot)

`authorkit autopilot` runs a **semi-autonomous loop** that stitches together clean AI sessions of the four commands above. A planning agent reads `authorkit status` each tick and picks the single next action; the loop dispatches it, then stops the moment a creative, structural, or quality decision is needed. It adds no new writing behavior — `review` still approves chapters exactly as it does by hand.

```bash
authorkit autopilot chapters --range 1-8            # plan -> draft -> review each chapter in range
authorkit autopilot plot --max-iters 10             # develop the outline / world / chapter plans
authorkit autopilot chapters --range 1-8 --dry-run  # show the next action; change nothing
authorkit autopilot chapters --range 1-8 \
  --guideline "re-review every chapter against the new tic patterns, revise drafts, then re-review"
```

- **Refuses without a seed.** `plot` needs `concept.md`; `chapters` additionally needs a filled constitution, `outline.md`, and a `chapters.md` covering the range.
- **Bounds:** `--range` for `chapters`, `--max-iters` for `plot`. `--dry-run` previews the next directive, `--step` runs one tick, `--commit` commits after each tick.
- **Guidelines (campaigns):** `--guideline "<directive>"` steers the planner for the run — it **overrides the default status ladder** and may re-open approved `[X]` chapters for a review/revise sweep (e.g. re-reviewing a finished manuscript against new rules). Under a guideline the loop skips the all-`[X]` auto-done (the planner owns completion) and measures progress by draft/review **content** as well as status, so a sweep over already-approved chapters isn't cut short. Available on both `chapters` and `plot`.
- **Tool access:** workers run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` by default (full, unattended tool access — required to write files and run the setup/world-index scripts); the loop prints a heads-up each run. Pass `--permission-mode <mode>` (e.g. `acceptEdits`, `default`) to restrict, noting tighter modes may stall on script steps.
- **Escalations.** When a decision is the author's to make, the loop writes an `OPEN` record to `book/escalations/` and halts. Resolve it with `/authorkit.discuss` (or `/authorkit.write N revise:` / `/authorkit.research`), which closes the record; the next run resumes. The loop never resolves its own escalations.
- **Audit & control:** every tick is logged to `book/runs/autopilot.jsonl`; drop a `book/runs/STOP` file to halt after the current tick.

See [docs/autopilot.md](docs/autopilot.md) for the full design and [docs/autopilot-implementation.md](docs/autopilot-implementation.md) for the build plan.

## World Maintenance

Author Kit includes a dedicated world-building system that tracks every detail of your book's world — characters, places, organizations, history, and systems — across the entire manuscript.

### Why?

As your book grows, keeping track of world details becomes harder. Was the tavern called The Iron Flagon or The Iron Flask? Did Iria have green eyes in chapter 2 and blue eyes in chapter 9? World maintenance prevents these consistency problems by maintaining a structured `world/` folder alongside your chapters.

### The `world/` Folder

```
world/
├── _index.md           # Auto-generated entity index (Entity Registry, Alias Lookup, Chapter Manifest)
├── characters/         # One file per major character (identity, appearance, relationships, arc)
├── organizations/      # Factions, guilds, governments, companies
├── places/             # Locations with descriptions, significance, geography
├── history/            # Past events, backstory, timeline
├── systems/            # Magic systems, technology, social structures, frameworks
└── notes/              # Miscellaneous world notes
```

Only relevant categories are created — a contemporary novel won't need a `systems/` folder for magic.

### Workflow

**1. Build the world** (before or after outlining) — via `/authorkit.discuss`:

```bash
/authorkit.discuss build the magic system and political structure
/authorkit.discuss flesh out the world
```

The model enters World Seed mode: it reads `concept.md` (and any `research/` you've grounded), picks the relevant categories for your genre (characters / places / organizations / history / systems / notes), proposes the entries it will write, and on approval seeds `world/` with `(CONCEPT)`-tagged entries plus YAML frontmatter, then rebuilds `world/_index.md`.

**2. Ground details with research** (optional, anytime):

```bash
/authorkit.research Research late-19th-century maritime law for this setting
/authorkit.research For chapter 4, research telegraph relay timing with web and wikipedia sources
/authorkit.research Research Victorian shipboard medical protocols
```

Default behavior writes only research artifacts (`research.md` + topic files in `research/`, flat-first, nested when a grouping reason exists). When findings are durable and clearly map to a `world/` category, the command **offers** world sync inline — gated by your chat approval. Existing note paths are updated in place; no forced migration.

**3. Reconcile after drafting** — automatic on `/authorkit.write`:

Every successful `/authorkit.write [N]` run finishes with a reconcile pass: it extracts new details from the chapter (tagged with the source chapter, e.g., `(CH03)`), refreshes the outline summary so it matches the drafted prose, updates `chapters.md` status, scans for new ambiguities, and rebuilds `world/_index.md`. If a draft contradicts an existing `(CONCEPT)` or `(CHxx)` entry, the contradiction is flagged with a recommendation to run `/authorkit.discuss "<change description>"` so the change is propagated consistently across all artifacts.

For a deeper verification pass (consistency between world/ and the manuscript, drift detection, overdue parked decisions, world rule violations), run:

```bash
/authorkit.review            # Whole-manuscript drift sweep (includes world consistency)
/authorkit.review 5-10       # Range-scoped: craft reviews + drift scan in 5-10
```

Findings are rated by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) with specific file paths and actionable recommendations.

The AI-tic gate (review Pass 2) also applies three density rules beyond per-shape budgets: a chapter-wide **tic-load** index that gates when many below-budget tics compound, a **cluster** rule for paragraphs carrying several distinct shapes, and a **persistence** check for shapes recurring below budget across consecutive chapters. All three thresholds default to 3 and can be tightened or relaxed per book via the `[review]` table in `book/book.toml` (see the baseline below).

### Entity body: Current State + History

Each world/ entity file keeps its body in two parts so it stays legible as the book grows:

- **`## Current State`** — the canonical now-truth (the entity as it stands at the latest drafted chapter), written in concise, untagged statements. Drafting and review read this as authoritative, so they never have to reconstruct the current picture from the full log.
- **`## History`** — the append-only, chapter-tagged provenance log of how the entity evolved. When a later chapter changes a fact, reconcile appends the tagged entry here and supersedes the matching Current State line in place.

This prevents long-running entity files from becoming palimpsests where the current truth is buried under layers of edits. A `/authorkit.review` consolidation pass can refresh a stale Current State and archive long-dead History entries (snapshot-gated).

### Evolution tags

`## History` entries are tagged to show how details evolve across the manuscript:

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `(CONCEPT)` | Established during pre-writing world-building |
| `(CHxx)` | First appeared or was confirmed in chapter xx |
| `(CHxx-rev)` | Updated when chapter xx was revised |
| `(AMEND-YYYY-MM-DD)` | Changed as part of a direction or fact amendment |

### Entity index

As a book's world grows, finding the right information becomes increasingly expensive — every world/-touching command would need to scan all files. Author Kit solves this with a **script-generated central index** at `world/_index.md` (built by `build-world-index.sh` on Linux/macOS or `build-world-index.ps1` on Windows), which costs zero LLM tokens to maintain.

world/ entity files can include **YAML frontmatter** with structured metadata (recommended but optional — files without frontmatter are still readable by all commands):

```yaml
---
id: char-vadek-dellhar
type: character
name: Vadek D'Ellhar
aliases: [Vadek, Dr. Ellhar, the Doctor, Ellhar]
chapters: [CONCEPT, CH01, CH03, CH05]
first_appearance: CH01
relationships:
  - target: char-marcus-reid
    type: mentor-of
    since: CONCEPT
tags: [protagonist, magic-user]
last_updated: 2025-02-14
---
```

The index (`world/_index.md`) contains three lookup tables:

| Section | Purpose | Example Query |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Entity Registry** | All entities with their IDs, names, file paths, and chapter tags | "Where is Iria's file?" |
| **Alias Lookup** | Maps every name variant to its entity (flags ambiguous aliases) | "Who is 'the Doctor'?" |
| **Chapter Manifest** | Inverted index: which entities appear in which chapter | "What world/ files do I need for CH05?" |

**Rebuilding the index:**

The index is rebuilt automatically by every command that touches `world/` files: `/authorkit.write` (after drafting / reconcile), `/authorkit.discuss` (after cross-cutting amendments, world seeding, or chapter restructuring), and `/authorkit.research` (when an author-approved sync writes to `world/notes/`). You only need to rebuild it manually if you've edited world/ files by hand — and `/authorkit.write` or `/authorkit.discuss` on its next run will rebuild it for you anyway.

Add YAML frontmatter to any world files that lack it by asking `/authorkit.discuss` to "add frontmatter to world files that lack it" — it routes through the same index-rebuild path.

---

## Mid-Process Changes

Books rarely go exactly according to plan. Once `concept.md` exists, everything iterative routes through `/authorkit.discuss`, which auto-detects the right mode from what you say:

| You want to... | Say... |
|----------------|--------|
| Resolve ambiguities in your concept (structured Q&A) | `/authorkit.discuss the X feels vague` |
| Brainstorm ideas | `/authorkit.discuss let's talk about the villain's motivation` |
| Get help on a specific passage while writing | `/authorkit.write [N] help improve the opening paragraph` |
| Ground a topic with sources and keep reusable notes | `/authorkit.research [topic]` |
| Change the book's direction or a specific fact | `/authorkit.discuss change Marcus from a soldier to a spy` |
| Decide something later | `/authorkit.discuss park: <question>` |
| Save your current state before a big change | (auto-snapshots before any cross-cutting amendment or what-if start; you can also say `/authorkit.discuss snapshot now: <description>`) |
| Try something without committing | `/authorkit.discuss try first person POV for the flashbacks` (creates a `whatif/*` branch) |
| Move, split, or merge chapters | `/authorkit.discuss move CH05 to after CH02` |
| Check if outline/concept drifted from drafts | `/authorkit.review` |
| Verify the world/ folder for internal consistency | `/authorkit.review` (world consistency is part of the manuscript drift sweep) |
| Fix issues found by review | `/authorkit.write [N] revise: <issue>` |

A few interactions worth knowing: what-if branching auto-creates a snapshot; cross-cutting amendments log to `amendments/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` and tag edits `(AMEND-YYYY-MM-DD)`; parked decisions surface in `/authorkit.review` reports and `authorkit status` once their deadline is past.

## Book Export, Audiobook and Statistics

Author Kit provides publishing commands directly in the installer CLI to export your work:

```bash
authorkit book build --format docx  # Export as Word (docx) or ebook (epub)
authorkit book audio --merge        # Generate an audio file per chapter or a single, final one
authorkit book stats --output json  # Compute statistics about the current book
```

Defaults and behavior:
- Source manuscript: `book/chapters/*/draft.md`
- Output directory: `book/dist/` (audio in `dist/audio/`)
- `authorkit init` seeds repo `.gitignore` with generated artifacts and local secrets (`dist/`, `.env`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, and the local `.codex/` auth/cache/session files) so they are never committed
- Metadata source: `book/book.toml` (created by `setup-book` scripts)
- Python dependencies for book audio/stats (`openai`, `python-dotenv`, `mutagen`) are installed with `authorkit-cli`
- Built-in style assets:
  - DOCX fallback: `.authorkit/templates/publishing/reference.docx`
  - EPUB fallback: `.authorkit/templates/publishing/epub.css`
  - Audio narration instructions: `.authorkit/templates/publishing/audio-instructions.txt`

`book.toml` baseline (created automatically):

```toml
[book]
title = "..."
author = "..."
language = "en-US"
subtitle = ""

[build]
default_formats = ["docx"]
reference_docx = ".authorkit/templates/publishing/reference.docx"
epub_css = ".authorkit/templates/publishing/epub.css"

[audio]
provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-4o-mini-tts"
voice = "marin"
instructions = ".authorkit/templates/publishing/audio-instructions.txt"
speaking_rate_wpm = 170

[stats]
reading_wpm = 200
# tts_cost_per_1m_chars = 0.000015   # uncomment and set to enable cost estimates in `authorkit book stats`

# Tic-gate density thresholds for /authorkit.review Pass 2 (all optional; lower = stricter).
# [review]
# tic_load_threshold = 3.0     # chapter-wide compounding load that gates (sum of instances/budget)
# cluster_min_shapes = 3       # distinct tic shapes in one paragraph that make a cluster finding
# persistence_chapters = 3     # consecutive chapters a below-budget tic may recur before flagged

# Per-operation model/effort overrides for `authorkit autopilot` (all optional —
# unset means no --model/--effort flag is passed, so the agent CLI's own default applies).
# [autopilot.planner]   # the meta-planner deciding each tick's next action
# model = ""
# effort = ""
# [autopilot.review]    # dispatched /authorkit.review commands
# model = ""
# effort = ""
# [autopilot.writer]    # dispatched /authorkit.write and /authorkit.research commands
# model = ""
# effort = ""
```

`authorkit book build` format options:
- Repeatable `--format` flag: `docx`, `epub`
- Example: `authorkit book build --format docx --format epub`
- If omitted, formats come from `[build].default_formats`
- If an output file already exists, `authorkit` prompts before overwrite
- Use `--force` to overwrite existing output files without prompts

`authorkit book audio` provider/auth and selection precedence:
- OpenAI is the only supported audio provider today (`[audio].provider = "openai"`); the knob exists for future providers.
  - [Get started](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs) to create an OpenAI account, enable audio models, and get a key
- Required auth: `OPENAI_API_KEY` in environment or local `.env`
- Voice selection order: `--voice` CLI flag, then `[audio].voice`, then default `marin`
  - You can explore optional voices using [openai.fm](https://github.com/openai/openai-fm)
- Model selection order: `--model` CLI flag, then `[audio].model`, then default `gpt-4o-mini-tts`
  - Read more about [OpenAI audio models](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/text-to-speech)
- Generated chapter files and merged audiobook output include ID3 metadata tags (title/album/artist/language and chapter tracking)
- OpenAI recommends `marin` or `cedar` voices for best quality. `marin` is the shipped default; switch to `cedar` (or any other supported voice) by setting `[audio].voice` in `book.toml` or passing `--voice`

Audio narration instructions:
- A template file controls narrator style sent to the TTS model via the `instructions` parameter
- Default template: `.authorkit/templates/publishing/audio-instructions.txt`
- Override with a custom file: set `instructions` in `[audio]` to your own path (absolute, relative to `book/`, or relative to repo root)
- Instructions selection order: `[audio].instructions` config path, then default template, then built-in fallback
- The default template follows openai.fm-style guidance covering voice, punctuation, delivery, phrasing, tone, pauses, and markdown handling

`authorkit autopilot` model/effort per operation (`[autopilot.*]` in `book.toml`):
- Point each of AutoPilot's three jobs at a different model — `planner` (decides what to do next each tick), `review` (runs `/authorkit.review`), `writer` (runs `/authorkit.write` and `/authorkit.research`) — e.g. a cheap model for planning and your strongest model for drafting.
- Uncomment and fill in whichever `[autopilot.*]` blocks you want in `book.toml`; leave the rest as-is. There's no built-in default and no CLI flag, so anything you don't set just uses your agent CLI's normal default.
- `model` takes whatever your AI flavor accepts (e.g. `haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus` for Claude); `effort` takes a reasoning-depth level such as `low`/`medium`/`high` (exact accepted values vary by flavor — see [docs/autopilot.md](docs/autopilot.md) for the per-flavor flag details).

## Troubleshooting Book CLI

### `authorkit book build` fails with Pandoc errors

- Symptom: missing binary or conversion failure mentioning `pandoc`.
- Cause: Pandoc is not installed or not on PATH.
- Fix:
  - Windows: `winget install --id JohnMacFarlane.Pandoc -e`
  - macOS: `brew install pandoc`
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install pandoc`
- After install, close and reopen your terminal so PATH is refreshed.
- Verify: `authorkit check` should show `pandoc: ok`.

### `authorkit book audio` fails with FFmpeg errors

- Symptom: concat/merge errors mentioning `ffmpeg`.
- Cause: FFmpeg is missing from PATH.
- Fix:
  - Windows: `winget install --id Gyan.FFmpeg -e`
  - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
- After install, close and reopen your terminal so PATH is refreshed.
- Verify: `authorkit check` should show `ffmpeg: ok`.

### `authorkit book audio` fails with authentication errors

- Symptom: error about missing API key or failed OpenAI auth.
- Cause: `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set (or invalid/expired).
- Fix:
  - Set env var for current shell/session, or
  - Store it in a local `.env` file (do not commit).
- Verify in shell:
  - PowerShell: `echo $env:OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - bash/zsh: `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Audio voice/model are not what you expect

- Selection precedence:
  1. CLI flags: `--voice`, `--model`
  2. `book/book.toml` (`[audio].voice`, `[audio].model`)
  3. Defaults: `voice = "marin"`, `model = "gpt-4o-mini-tts"`

### Existing audio files are not overwritten

- Default behavior is interactive prompt per existing chapter file.
- Use `--force` to bypass prompt logic.
- Use `--yes` for non-interactive acceptance (CI-friendly).

### Existing manuscript outputs are not overwritten

- Default behavior is interactive prompt per existing format (e.g. `manuscript.docx`).
- Use `authorkit book build --force` to overwrite without prompts.
- Use `authorkit book build --yes` to auto-accept overwrite prompts (CI-friendly).
- Use `--quiet` to suppress per-format status lines.

### Audio metadata tags are missing

- New audio runs write ID3 metadata automatically.
- If older files were created before metadata support, rerun `authorkit book audio` for those chapters.

### Audio delivery sounds flat or unnatural

- Verify the selected voice/model and try regenerating with `--force`.
- Customize the narration instructions template at `.authorkit/templates/publishing/audio-instructions.txt` or provide your own via `[audio].instructions` in `book.toml`.
- OpenAI recommends `marin` (the shipped default) or `cedar` for best quality.

## Beyond the Code Editor: The Future of Author Kit

Interested in seeing the capacity from Author Kit as a full-fledged book editor experience that does not require being tech-savvy in code editors and AIs? [Contact us](mailto:mazemerize@outlook.com), we would like to hear from you.
