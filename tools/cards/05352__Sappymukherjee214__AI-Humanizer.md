## 🎯 Overview

AI Humanizer is an advanced, full-stack application that solves the growing challenge of AI content detection and machine-like writing. Built with Node.js, React 19, and PostgreSQL, it provides users with a comprehensive **Iterative Detection-Refinement Loop**, ensuring AI-generated text consistently passes audits (like GPTZero) while maintaining impeccable flow.

### What Makes AI Humanizer Different

- **Evidence-Based Refinement**: Grounded in linguistic analysis and adversarial detection theory.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Real-time sentiment preservation and pattern detection via Gemini Pro.
- **Recursive Optimization**: Rewrites content until the AI Probability Score drops below **15%**.
- **Privacy-First**: Secure JWT-based authentication and modular processing of sensitive documents.
- **Research-Driven**: Incorporates findings on machine-sounding syntax to deliver human-like prose.

## 🛠️ Developer Workflow

> [!TIP]
> **Prisma Studio**: Use `npx prisma studio` in the backend directory to instantly visualize and edit your local database.

---

> [!TIP]
> **Contributing Workflow**: If you are contributing specifically to the Web frontend, ensure the **Backend API** is running so the dashboard can fetch state.

> [!NOTE]
> For detailed architecture, sidecar management, and GSSoC'26 guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Sappymukherjee214/AI-Humanizer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/Sappymukherjee214/AI-Humanizer/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
