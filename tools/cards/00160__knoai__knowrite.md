## 🌐 Remote Experience
No deployment required, experience online directly:

| Service | Address |
|---------|---------|
| 🖥️ Online Demo | http://14.103.155.159:25175/ |


AI Agents autonomously write novels — draft, review, revise, and evaluate, fully automated. A multi-agent collaborative engineering pipeline covering strict industrial-grade review and free creative modes, with built-in RAG vector memory, five-dimensional Fitness quality assessment, automatic Prompt evolution, book deconstruction, and Skill extraction.

**Knowrite is a Node.js / Express backend service** providing a complete automated novel creation API from outline generation, chapter writing, editorial review, de-AIization, reader feedback to quality assessment. **All model calls use a unified OpenAI-compatible protocol** — users configure their own Provider, Base URL, and API Key. No built-in default models, zero external vector database dependencies, runs on a single node.

Companion frontend [`knowrite-ui`](https://github.com/knoai/knowrite-ui) (React 19 + Vite + Tailwind CSS, MIT license) provides work management, real-time creation flow visualization, Fitness dashboard, world-building editor, Prompt management, Plan preview, Trace debugger, and real-time log panel.

> **📁 Work Storage**: SQLite primary storage + local file dual-write mechanism. All chapter text, outlines, and review records are stored in `data/novel.db`, while automatically backed up to `works/<workId>/` directory as `.txt` / `.json` files for easy access.

---

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js 24+
- Any OpenAI-compatible API Key (user-configured Provider)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone backend repo
git clone https://github.com/knoai/knowrite.git
cd knowrite

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables (copy template and edit as needed)
cp .env.example .env

# Start service
npm start
# Service runs at http://localhost:8000

# ⚠️ First-time setup: You MUST configure models first:
# Open frontend "Settings → Model Config", add a Provider (e.g. Qwen/Bailian/DeepSeek),
# fill in Base URL, API Key, and model list, then assign models to each role.
```

### Frontend Dev

```bash
# In another terminal, start the companion frontend
cd ../knowrite-ui
npm install
npm run dev
# Frontend runs at http://localhost:5173, auto-proxies to backend
```

### Write Your First Novel

```bash
# Create a work
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/novel/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic":"Cultivation Novel","platformStyle":"Fanqie","authorStyle":"Hot-blooded","strategy":"knowrite"}'

# Continue next chapter (SSE streaming)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/novel/continue \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

## Core Features

### Multi-Agent Writing Pipeline

Each chapter is completed by multiple Agents in relay, zero manual intervention:

| Agent | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| **Writer** | Generates draft based on outline + smart context (word count governance + anti-repetition reminders + RAG retrieval injection) |
| **Editor** | Structured review (`[YES]`/`[NO]` dual-pass standard), up to 3 revision rounds |
| **Humanizer** | De-AI processing to eliminate LLM frequent words, monotonous sentence patterns, and excessive summarization traces |
| **Proofreader** | Proofreading and polishing (industrial mode) or skipped (free mode) |
| **Reader** | Simulates reader perspective, outputs structured feedback (immersion / pacing / character identification) |
| **Summarizer** | Generates chapter summary, auto-indexed to RAG vector database |
| **Fitness** | Five-dimensional quantitative scoring (word count / repetition / review / reader / coherence), auto-saved |

If Editor review fails, the pipeline automatically enters a "revise → re-review" loop until passed or max rounds reached.

### Editor Dual-Pass Standard

Editor review is not just about "feeling" — it's a structured judgment:

- **Keyword pass**: Must explicitly output `[YES]` to pass; `[NO]` immediately enters next revision round
- **Dimension pass rate**: Among 8~33 review dimensions, pass rate must be ≥ 80%
- **Historical feedback injection**: From round 2 onwards, Editor automatically sees previous rounds' review comments and revision traces, avoiding repeated mistakes
- **Review record persistence**: Each round's review results are auto-saved as `review_chapter_{n}/round_{i}.json` for Fitness assessment and human review

### Fitness Five-Dimensional Quality Assessment

Automatically scored after each chapter completion, no manual intervention needed:

| Dimension | Evaluation Content | Weight |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **Word Count** | Deviation from target word count (Gaussian distribution scoring) | 20% |
| **Repetition** | Content repetition detection with historical chapters | 20% |
| **Review** | Editor review pass rate | 20% |
| **Reader** | Simulated reader feedback score | 20% |
| **Coherence** | Outline deviation detection (low/medium/high severity mapping) | 20% |

Fitness scores are written to `fitness.json` in real-time; the frontend Fitness dashboard can directly display trend charts.

### RAG Vector Memory Retrieval

Zero external vector database dependency, pure JS implementation:

- **Embedding generation**: Calls Provider's `/v1/embeddings` endpoint (reuses same API Key)
- **Vector storage**: SQLite JSON column stores embeddings, auto-indexed
- **Similarity calculation**: Pure JS cosine similarity, chapter summary retrieval threshold 0.65, character/setting retrieval threshold 0.7
- **Auto-indexing**: After each chapter's Summarizer completes, summary is automatically encoded and stored
- **Context injection**: Before Writer writes, automatically retrieves Top-3 relevant historical chapter summaries and injects into prompt

### Three-Layer Memory System

Unified memory architecture integrating dispersed memory modules into a three-layer model:

| Layer | Name | Content | Module |
|-------|------|---------|--------|
| **L1** | Working Memory | Current chapter's active context window | `context-builder.js` |
| **L2** | Episodic Memory | Character experiences, event flows, timelines | `character-memory.js` + `temporal-truth.js` |
| **L3** | Semantic Memory | Worldview, rules, character settings, voice dictionary | `world-context.js` + `voice-fingerprint.js` |

### Character Episodic Memory

Maintains independent experience archives for each character:

- **Experience extraction**: Automatically extracts character's major events, dialogues, relationship changes, and emotional turns from chapter summaries
- **Experience types**: event / dialogue / relationship_change / emotional_turn / goal_progress / knowledge_gain
- **Memory injection**: Before Writer writes, automatically retrieves relevant character's recent experiences and injects into prompt
- **Persistence**: Character memories are stored in both SQLite and `works/<workId>/characters/<name>.json`

### Voice Fingerprint Dictionary

Extracts character dialogue "voice prints" from chapter text to ensure consistent speaking style:

- **Statistical dimensions**: Average sentence length, sentence templates, frequent words/catchphrases (TF-IDF), tone markers, rhetorical preferences, person ratios
- **Auto-extraction**: After each chapter completes, automatically parses dialogues and updates corresponding character's voice data
- **Writing injection**: Writer receives target character's voice constraints to maintain dialogue style consistency

### Book Deconstruction

Upload any novel text, AI automatically deconstructs it into structured creative material:

- **Structure analysis**: Template patterns, chapter structure, beat density
- **Character analysis**: Character settings, relationship networks, growth arcs
- **Worldview analysis**: Force distribution, power systems, setting rules
- **Style analysis**: Reuses AuthorFingerprint module to extract language style
- **One-click creation**: Deconstruction results can directly generate `StoryTemplate` + `AuthorFingerprint` + Prompt

### Skill Auto-Extraction

Automatically distills reusable creative skills from high-scoring chapters:

- **Trigger condition**: Automatically triggers extraction when N consecutive chapters have Fitness ≥ threshold
- **Skill format**: Markdown metadata (name / tags / fitnessThreshold / extractedFrom) + creative key points body
- **Auto-injection**: During subsequent work creation, Skills matching current genre tags are automatically injected into Writer prompt
- **Persistence**: Extracted Skills are saved to `skills/generated/` directory

### Chat Agent

Interact with works through natural language dialogue:

- **Continue/Revise**: "Make the battle scene in Chapter 3 more intense"
- **Query info**: "What cultivation realm has the protagonist reached?"
- **Creative advice**: "How should I arrange a plot twist next?"
- **Context awareness**: Agent automatically loads the work's complete context (meta, outline, chapters, settings, characters) before responding

### MCP Server

Built-in lightweight [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server (JSON-RPC 2.0 + SSE):

- **`search_hot_novels`** — Search popular novel database for genre references
- **`extract_novel_features`** — Extract novel features and save as templates
- Supports direct connection from Cursor / Claude Code and other MCP clients

### Outline Deviation Detection

AI automatically determines if chapter content deviates from the established outline:

- **low**: Slight deviation, Fitness coherence score = 1.0
- **medium**: Moderate deviation, Fitness coherence score = 0.6, triggers warning
- **high**: Severe deviation, Fitness coherence score = 0.3, can trigger automatic correction rewrite

### Prompt Auto-Evolution

Automatically optimizes Prompts based on Fitness low-score samples:

1. **Collect defects**: Extract chapters with Fitness score < 0.6 and corresponding Editor review comments
2. **Analyze root cause**: Identify whether it's unclear Prompt expression, insufficient constraints, or missing examples
3. **Generate variants**: Based on defect analysis, generate 3~5 Prompt variants
4. **Evaluate and select**: Use historical chapters for backtesting, select the variant with maximum Fitness improvement
5. **Progressive replacement**: New variants only take effect for subsequent new chapters, not affecting historical works

### Smart Context Management

Writer doesn't blindly stack context, but assembles it in layers:

| Context Layer | Content | Source |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| Near History Full Text | Full text of previous 4 chapters | `raw.txt` |
| Near History Summary | Chapter summaries of previous 5 chapters | `summary.txt` |
| Far History Compression | Ultra-compressed synopsis of earlier chapters | `compress-distant` prompt |
| Worldview | Characters, settings, plotlines, maps | SQLite memory database |
| RAG Retrieval | Semantically similar historical chapters/settings | Top-3 vector similarity |
| Anti-Repetition Reminder | Plot elements already appeared in near history | `antiRepeat` auto-extraction |
| Character Memory | Target character's recent experiences | `character-memory.js` |
| Voice Constraints | Target character's dialogue style | `voice-fingerprint.js` |

### Dual Strategy Modes

- **`knowrite`** (default): 7-Agent full pipeline, quality-first
- **`pipeline`**: Lightweight single-model fast mode, speed-first

Switch at runtime via `strategy` parameter; same work can use different strategies for different chapters.

### Writer Rotation

Multi-model chapter-by-chapter rotation to avoid single-model style固化. Configure `writerRotation.models` in "Settings → Model Config", system automatically rotates.

### Worldview Memory Database

Complete world-building data model:

| Entity | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Character** | Character profiles, relationship networks, appearance records |
| **WorldLore** | Worldview settings, force distribution, historical events |
| **PlotLine / PlotNode** | Plotline structure and node status |
| **MapRegion / MapConnection** | Map regions and connectivity |
| **StoryTemplate** | Template pattern library (reusable plot structures) |

All data managed through REST API CRUD, automatically injected into context during writing.

### Input Governance

Zero-LLM-call intent compilation and context selection before writing:

| Layer | Entity | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **L1 Long-term Vision** | `AuthorIntent` | Work-level themes, constraints, must-keep/avoid |
| **L2 Current Focus** | `CurrentFocus` | Short-term creative goals (target chapter count, priority, expiration) |
| **L3 Chapter Intent** | `ChapterIntent` | Single-chapter mustKeep / mustAvoid / scene beats / emotional goals / rule stack |

Flow: `planChapter()` compiles intent → `composeChapter()` selects truth fragments + worldview context → `getGovernanceVariables()` injects into Writer prompt.

### Temporal Truth Database

Event-sourcing driven world state tracking, supporting time-travel queries:

- **Event stream** (`TruthEvent`): Immutable append-only, records character position changes, foreshadowing creation, resource acquisition, etc.
- **Materialized views** (`TruthState`): Historical state snapshots at any chapter
- **Promise tracking** (`TruthHook`): Foreshadowing/suspense creation and resolution status
- **Resource ledger** (`TruthResource`): Item quantities and transfer history

After each chapter's Summarizer completes, automatically extracts delta events; Editor and Reader can query character states and detect resource contradictions.

### Full-Dimension Author Fingerprint

Five-layer style fingerprint analysis + auto-injection + compliance detection:

| Layer | Analysis Dimension | Detection Content |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Narrative** | POV, scene switching, chapter structure | Perspective consistency, transition methods |
| **Character** | Naming habits, character voice | Naming patterns, dialogue characteristics |
| **Plot** | Chapter structure, beat density | Rhythm distribution, conflict density |
| **Language** | Sentence length distribution, word frequency, dialogue ratio | Sentence diversity, frequent words |
| **Worldview** | Setting types, power systems | Setting complexity, consistency |

Statistical extraction + LLM style guide extraction dual mode; auto-injects constraints before writing, detects style deviation after writing.

### Output Governance

Producer-consumer decoupled pre-publication verification pipeline:

- **L1 Auto-verification**: Truth consistency, style compliance, format validation, content policy
- **L2 LLM verification**: Readability, emotional continuity, anti-AI detection
- **State machine**: `pending → validating → approved | rejected → human_review → released`
- **Manual gate**: Must pass `release` operation to be officially published

### Agent-Level Model Configuration

Breaks the "one default model for all" limitation by independently assigning Provider and model for each Agent role:

- **Three-level priority chain**: `agentModels[role]` > `roleDefaults[role]` > `provider default`
- **Independent config**: Each Agent can separately set Provider, Model, Temperature
- **Batch management**: Supports one-click save of all Agent model assignments
- **Frontend panel**: "Settings → Agent Model Assignment" visual table, supports one-click sync from roleDefaults

### Plan Mode (Chapter Preview)

Before Writer starts, Planner Agent generates narrative beats for this chapter; author confirms before entering full writing pipeline:

- **Narrative beats**: Type / description / word count / must-include elements
- **Overall tone**: Writing style, pacing, emotional direction
- **Risk alerts**: Potential deviations, logic hole warnings
- **Confirm and continue**: After Plan confirmation, auto-injected into Writer prompt, seamlessly connecting to pipeline
- **Independent page**: `/plan?workId=xxx` independent preview page, WorksPage one-click plan modal

### Dynamic Pipeline Configuration

7-Agent writing pipeline is no longer "all or nothing" — stages can be flexibly toggled and auto-skipped:

- **Stage toggles**: Writer / Editor / Humanizer / Proofreader / Reader / Summarizer / Fitness can be independently enabled/disabled
- **Plan mode toggle**: Global control over whether chapter preview is enabled
- **AutoSkip**: Automatically skips low-value stages based on Fitness history (e.g., if Editor pass rate is 100% for consecutive chapters, subsequent chapters auto-skip Proofreader)
- **Frontend config**: "Settings → Pipeline Config" Tab for visual control

### Trace Debugger

Full LLM call chain traceability — a powerful tool for investigating "why it didn't write well":

- **Call statistics**: Per-Agent call count, token consumption, average latency
- **Timeline view**: Complete call chain sorted by chapter time
- **Agent filtering**: Single Agent historical record tracing
- **Dual-source reading**: DB (fileStore) + local file system, prioritizing file system
- **Frontend debugger**: `/traces` independent page, Agent stat cards + call timeline + detailed record filtering

## Product Matrix & Long-term Plan

The Knowrite engine is designed as a **general-purpose creation backend**, supporting multiple frontend scenario reuse:

| Product | Frontend Repo | Scenario | Status |
|---------|--------------|----------|--------|
| **Novel Writing** | `knowrite-ui` | Long-form fiction / web novels / IP development | ✅ Live |
| **Desktop** | `knowrite-desktop` (branch) | Electron desktop client, offline work management | 🚧 Branch in development |
| **Cloud Docs** | `knowrite-docs` (planned) | White papers / technical docs / reports | 🚧 Planned |
| **Tech Books** | `knowrite-techbook` (planned) | Technical tutorials / books / course materials | 🚧 Planned |
| **SaaS Platform** | Unified admin backend | Multi-tenant / paid subscriptions / team collaboration | 🚧 Planned |

All products share the same backend engine, switching different creation modes via `strategy` and `sourceType`. See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for details.

---

## Contributing

Welcome code contributions, issues, and PRs.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Development mode (node --watch hot restart)
npm start          # Production mode
npm test           # Run tests
npm run test:watch # Watch mode testing
```

### Security Features

- **Auth**: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `X-API-Key: <token>`
- **Rate limiting**: `express-rate-limit`, default 120 requests/minute (SSE log stream `/api/logs/stream` skips rate limiting)
- **CORS**: Configurable allowed origins
- **Path traversal**: `workId` sanitized via `sanitizeWorkId`, prohibits `../` and special characters
- **Input validation**: All routes use Zod Schema request validation
- **API Key encryption**: Config keys prefer AES-256-GCM encrypted storage (requires `ENCRYPTION_KEY`), fallback to base64 encoding when not configured
