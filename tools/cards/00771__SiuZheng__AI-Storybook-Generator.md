# 📖 Storybook AI Generator

## Overview
The **Storybook AI Generator** is an interactive web application built with **Streamlit** and **Google Gemini AI**. It allows users to generate complete, fully illustrated storybooks from a simple title and genre. The tool uses advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to write the story and character descriptions, and state-of-the-art image generation models to create consistent illustrations for every page.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Story Generation
- **Customizable Settings**: Define your story's Title, Genre, Tone, Art Style, Target Age, and Page Count.
- **AI Writer**: Automatically generates a cohesive story script divided into pages, along with detailed image prompts for each scene.

### 2. Character Consistency & Customization
- **Character Setup**: The AI identifies main characters and generates their physical descriptions.
- **Visual Consistency**: You can generate reference images for your characters or upload your own. These reference images are used during the story generation process to ensure characters look the same across different pages.
- **Image-to-Image Refinement**: If you're not happy with a character's look, you can regenerate it using the existing image as a base to refine the design while keeping the pose or composition.

### 3. AI Illustration
- **Batch Generation**: Generates illustrations for the entire story in one go.
- **Smart Prompts**: Uses context-aware prompts that include character descriptions to maintain visual continuity.

### 4. Interactive Editing & Regeneration
- **Read Mode**: View your generated storybook side-by-side with text and images.
- **Regeneration**: Don't like a specific page's illustration? You can:
    -   **Edit the Prompt**: Tweak the text description and regenerate.
    -   **Re-generate**: Create a completely new image.
    -   **Re-generate with Original**: Use the current image as a reference to make subtle changes (Image-to-Image).

### 5. Export
- **Download**: Export all your generated assets (Story Images and Character Images) as a structured ZIP file, ready for publishing or sharing.
