## The Paradigm Shift

### Before Flow: Fragmentation

```bash
# Install Claude Code... or wait, should I use OpenCode?
# Or maybe Cursor? Or that other AI CLI?
# Which one supports my workflow?
# Do I need to install multiple tools?
# How do I switch between them?
# 😵 The cognitive overhead is real
```

### With Flow: Unification

```bash
# Install once
npm install -g @sylphx/flow

# Use everywhere
sylphx-flow "build the future"

# Flow handles everything:
✅ Auto-detects your environment (Claude Code/OpenCode/Cursor)
✅ Auto-installs missing dependencies
✅ Auto-upgrades before each session
✅ One CLI, infinite possibilities
```

### Codex Setup

Flow ships canonical agent assets and projects them into each supported AI coding tool. Codex is one projection target:

```bash
sylphx-flow codex install
sylphx-flow codex doctor
```

`install` projects Flow assets into `~/.codex`: the canonical Builder agent is transformed into Codex's `AGENTS.md`, while standards and skills come from the same assets used by every supported tool. `doctor` verifies the local machine is synchronized.

Flow's runtime attach path uses the same canonical asset source for supported CLI targets: agents, standards, and skills are read from `packages/flow/assets/` and projected into the target's supported file layout.

---

## Philosophy: Transcendent Simplicity

**Flow is not just another AI CLI. It's the meta-layer that unifies them all.**

Traditional AI CLIs make you choose. Flow makes you powerful.

## 🚀 Installation

### The Sacred Ritual (30 seconds)

```bash
# Install the omnipotent CLI
npm install -g @sylphx/flow

# That's it. Seriously.
```

### First Invocation

```bash
# Your first command
sylphx-flow "build me something amazing"

# Flow automatically:
✅ Detects your environment
✅ Installs Claude Code/OpenCode if missing
✅ Configures optimal settings
✅ Updates to latest version
✅ And executes your will
```

**No setup. No configuration. No friction. Pure transcendence.**

---

## 🌟 Core Principles

### 1. **Universal Orchestration**

**One CLI for every AI development tool.**

Flow doesn't replace your favorite tools—it orchestrates them. Whether you prefer Claude Code, OpenCode, or any future AI CLI, Flow adapts seamlessly.

```bash
# Flow automatically detects and uses the best available tool
sylphx-flow "implement authentication"

# Detected Claude Code → Uses Claude Code
# Detected OpenCode → Uses OpenCode
# Detected both → Asks your preference
# Detected neither → Installs and configures for you
```

### 2. **Zero-Friction Experience**

**AI should adapt to you, not the other way around.**

```bash
# Traditional AI CLIs
❌ Install tool A for feature X
❌ Install tool B for feature Y
❌ Learn different commands
❌ Manage different configs
❌ Update each tool separately

# With Flow
✅ Install once: npm install -g @sylphx/flow
✅ Use everywhere: sylphx-flow "your intent"
✅ Everything automatic: detection, installation, updates
```

### 3. **Intelligent Automation**

**Flow thinks ahead so you don't have to.**

#### Auto-Detection
```bash
# Flow scans your system:
→ Claude Code installed? Use it.
→ OpenCode installed? Use it.
→ Nothing installed? Ask user preference, then install.
→ Both installed? Use smart defaults or ask.
```

#### Auto-Installation
```bash
# User doesn't have Claude Code
$ sylphx-flow "task"

> No AI CLI detected. Which would you like to use?
  1. Claude Code (Anthropic, recommended)
  2. OpenCode (open source)

> You selected: Claude Code
> Installing Claude Code...
> ✓ Installation complete
> ✓ Configuration optimized
> Executing your task...
```

#### Auto-Upgrade
```bash
# Every session starts fresh
$ sylphx-flow "task"

> Checking for updates...
> ✓ Flow 2.0.0 → 2.1.0 (latest)
> ✓ Claude Code 1.5.0 → 1.6.0 (latest)
> Executing your task with latest capabilities...
```

### 4. **Settings-Driven Excellence**

**Configure once, perfect forever.**

Flow introduces a revolutionary settings system that puts you in complete control:

```bash
# Access the settings nexus
sylphx-flow settings

# Configure everything:
→ 🤖 Agents: Enable/disable agents (coder, writer, reviewer, orchestrator)
→ 📋 Rules: Control which best practices apply
→ 🎨 Output Styles: Customize AI behavior
→ 📡 MCP Servers: Extend capabilities
→ 🔑 Providers: Manage API keys (Anthropic, Kimi, Z.AI)
→ 🎯 Platform: Set default target (Claude Code/OpenCode)
```

**Settings are stored globally** (`~/.sylphx-flow/`), ensuring consistency across all your projects.

### 5. **Git-Aware Intelligence**

**Flow understands version control is sacred.**

When Flow modifies settings files (`.claude/`, `.opencode/`), it uses `git update-index --skip-worktree` to hide changes from git status. This means:

- ✅ LLMs won't accidentally commit Flow's temporary changes
- ✅ Your version-controlled settings remain pristine
- ✅ Automatic restore after each session
- ✅ Seamless collaboration with your team

### 6. **Graceful Interruption**

**Ctrl+C now means "restore and exit," not "crash and burn."**

Press Ctrl+C at any time:
```bash
$ sylphx-flow "long task"
# ... working ...
^C

> ⚠️  Operation cancelled by user
> ✓ Settings restored
> ✓ Git tracking restored
> ✓ Environment clean

# No crashed sessions. No manual recovery.
```

## 🧠 Domain Skills

**25 domain-specific skills with expert-level knowledge built-in.**

Flow includes curated best practices for critical domains. When you work on auth, billing, or security, the AI knows the non-negotiables:

| Category | Skills |
|----------|--------|
| **Security** | `auth`, `account-security`, `security`, `trust-safety`, `privacy` |
| **Payments** | `billing`, `pricing`, `ledger` |
| **Data** | `database`, `data-architecture`, `storage` |
| **Frontend** | `uiux`, `pwa`, `performance`, `seo`, `i18n` |
| **Backend** | `observability`, `operability`, `delivery` |
| **Growth** | `growth`, `referral`, `support`, `admin`, `discovery` |
| **Quality** | `code-quality` |

**Example: Billing skill includes:**
- ✅ Webhook signature verification (non-negotiable)
- ✅ Idempotency with Stripe event IDs
- ✅ Out-of-order webhook handling
- ✅ No dual-write patterns
- ✅ Dunning and failed payment recovery

**Example: Auth skill includes:**
- ✅ Server-enforced authorization (never trust client)

---

## 🎯 Core Features

### 1. Universal CLI Orchestration

**One interface. All tools. Zero friction.**

Flow intelligently detects and orchestrates:
- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's official CLI
- **OpenCode** - Open source alternative
- **Future tools** - Built for extensibility

```bash
# Same command, different environments
# Flow adapts automatically

# On machine with Claude Code
$ sylphx-flow "task" → Uses Claude Code

# On machine with OpenCode
$ sylphx-flow "task" → Uses OpenCode

# On machine with both
$ sylphx-flow "task" → Uses your preferred default
```

### 2. Automatic Installation

**Missing tools? Flow installs them for you.**

```bash
# First time on a new machine
$ sylphx-flow "build something"

> No AI CLI detected.
> Which platform would you like to use?
  1. Claude Code (Anthropic, recommended)
  2. OpenCode (open source alternative)

> Your choice: 1

> Installing Claude Code...
> ✓ Downloaded latest version
> ✓ Configured settings
> ✓ Installed MCP servers
> ✓ Ready to execute

> Executing your command...
```

### 3. Automatic Upgrades

**Every session uses the latest capabilities.**

Flow checks for updates before each execution:

```bash
$ sylphx-flow "task"

> Checking for updates...
> Updates found:
  • Flow: 2.0.0 → 2.1.0
  • Claude Code: 1.5.0 → 1.6.0

> Upgrading...
> ✓ Flow updated (new features available)
> ✓ Claude Code updated (performance improved)

> Executing with latest versions...
```

**Customize update behavior:**
```bash
# Check updates without executing
sylphx-flow upgrade

# Auto-upgrade and execute
sylphx-flow upgrade --auto
```

### 4. MEP Architecture

**Minimal Effective Prompt: AI that truly understands context.**

Flow automatically enriches every prompt with:
- 🔍 Your codebase patterns (via semantic search)
- 📚 Best practices (via curated knowledge base)
- 🖥️ Your environment (OS, Node version, git status)
- ⏰ Current time and date
- 🎯 Your preferred coding style

```bash
# You type 3 words
sylphx-flow "implement authentication"

# Flow expands to full context:
→ Tech stack: TypeScript + React + Next.js (detected)
→ Patterns: Your existing auth patterns (searched)
→ Best practices: JWT, bcrypt, RBAC (knowledge base)
→ Environment: macOS, Node 20, git clean (hooks)
→ Time: 2025-11-23 (system)

# Result: Perfect, production-ready code
```

### 5. Settings-Driven Execution

**Configure once. Perfect forever.**

```bash
# Access settings nexus
sylphx-flow settings

# Configure:
→ Agents (coder, writer, reviewer, orchestrator)
→ Rules (core, code-standards, workspace)
→ Output styles (silent, verbose, tutorial)
→ MCP servers (grep, context7, playwright, github, notion)
→ Providers (Anthropic, Kimi, Z.AI)
→ Target platform (Claude Code, OpenCode)

# Settings apply to ALL subsequent executions
```

### 6. Git-Aware Operations

**Flow respects your version control.**

When Flow operates, it uses `git update-index --skip-worktree` to hide temporary changes:

```bash
# Before Flow execution
$ git status
→ clean working directory

# During Flow execution (modifying .claude/config.json)
$ git status
→ clean working directory  # Changes hidden!

# After Flow execution
$ git status
→ clean working directory  # Restored automatically
```

This ensures:
- LLMs won't see or commit Flow's temporary settings
- Your version-controlled configs remain pristine
- Team collaboration stays clean

---

## 🏗️ Advanced Features

### Loop Mode - Autonomous Execution

**Set it and forget it. Flow works while you sleep.**

```bash
# Continuous autonomous work
sylphx-flow "process all GitHub issues" --loop

# With polling interval
sylphx-flow "monitor and fix bugs" --loop 300 --max-runs 20
# Checks every 5 minutes, max 20 iterations

# How it works:
→ Iteration 1: Fresh start
→ Iteration 2+: Auto-continue with context
→ Stop: Ctrl+C (graceful) or max runs reached
```

**Perfect for:**
- 🔄 Processing backlogs (issues, PRs, tickets)
- 📊 Periodic monitoring and auto-fixing
- 🧹 Incremental refactoring
- 🧪 Continuous test fixing
- 📝 Documentation maintenance

### File Input Support

**Complex prompts deserve better than shell escaping.**

```bash
# Load prompt from file
sylphx-flow "@task.txt"

# Absolute paths supported
sylphx-flow "@/path/to/detailed-requirements.md"

# Combine with other flags
sylphx-flow "@refactor-plan.md" --agent orchestrator --loop
```

**Benefits:**
- 📝 Write natural language (no shell escaping)
- 🔄 Version control your prompts
- 🔀 Reusable task definitions
- 🚀 No character limits

### Codebase Search - Semantic Understanding

**Find code by what it does, not what it's called.**

```bash
# Search by functionality
sylphx-flow codebase search "user authentication logic"

# Works across languages
→ Finds: authenticateUser() in TypeScript
→ Finds: authenticate_user() in Python
→ Finds: AuthenticateUser() in Go

# Multilingual queries
sylphx-flow codebase search "處理用戶登入嘅邏輯"  # Chinese
sylphx-flow codebase search "ユーザーログイン処理"  # Japanese

# Reindex after major changes
sylphx-flow codebase reindex
```

**Powered by StarCoder2 tokenization** - 70+ languages supported.

### Knowledge Base - Curated Best Practices

**Professional knowledge, zero maintenance.**

```bash
# Search best practices
sylphx-flow knowledge search "react performance optimization"
sylphx-flow knowledge search "secure password hashing"
sylphx-flow knowledge search "microservices patterns"

# List all knowledge
sylphx-flow knowledge list

# Update to latest
