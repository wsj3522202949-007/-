# SlopGuard — The Internet's Quality Layer

> **Every other tool asks "was this AI-generated?" — that's the wrong question.**
>
> SlopGuard asks: **"Did a human actually think about this before publishing?"**

That distinction is what makes it unfakeable. You can't prompt-engineer your way to a high counterfactual absence score. You can't fake a human-shaped vocabulary novelty curve. You can't game a system that measures *thinking*, not authorship.

|---|---|
| **F1 Score** | **0.926** on 453 labeled samples |
| **Score Gap** | +13.8 pts (slop vs reviewed content) |
| **Signals** | 10 universal · 3 novel (prize targets) |
| **Tracks** | 8 domain tracks (A–H) |
| **Tests** | 66 passing |
| **Primary Track** | **A — Code Review** |
| **Live Demo** | `docker-compose up --build` → `http://localhost:8000/live` |

## ⚡ Try It in 30 Seconds

```bash
docker-compose up --build
# API:       http://localhost:8000
# Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
# Live feed: http://localhost:8000/live
```

Or run just the API:

```bash
cd apps/api
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn slopguard.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Test immediately:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/score/text \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"This update improves the system and enhances user experience.","domain":"content"}'
```

---

## 🧠 What It Does

Paste a PR description, article, review, or abstract. SlopGuard returns:

- **Score 0–100** measuring human oversight quality
- **Verdict**: `high` / `mixed` / `low` / `insufficient`
- **Per-signal breakdown** — which of the 10 signals fired and why
- **Flagged passages** — specific sentences with unfalsifiable reasoning
- **Improvement suggestions** — targeted questions, not generic advice
- **Relative score** — how this compares to your repo history and global baseline

## 🏆 Three Novel Signals — Sharpest Signal Prize

These three signals are original detection angles that no existing tool has implemented. They are technically sophisticated, hard to fake, and visually immediate.

---

### ⭐ 1. Epistemic Cowardice (Weight: 1.5)

**The Insight:** AI systematically avoids taking positions. It hedges everything, presents "both sides," and never commits to a recommendation.

**What It Detects:**
| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| Hedge clustering | "may", "might", "could", "potentially" — 2+ per paragraph |
| False balance | "on one hand… on the other hand" with no resolution |
| Opinion laundering | "some experts say", "many believe" — no named source |
| Responsibility deflection | "it depends", "consult an expert" as a conclusion |
| Commitment absence | Zero falsifiable predictions in the entire document |

**Why It's Hard to Fake:** To score well, you must actually commit to something — "do this, not that, because X." AI systems are trained to be helpful to everyone, which means committing to nothing.

```bash
# Cowardly (AI) — scores 0.15
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/signals/epistemic-cowardice \
  -d '{"text":"You might want to consider Redis, depending on your use case. It could improve performance in some scenarios, though results may vary.","domain":"code_review"}'

# Committed (Human) — scores 0.82
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/signals/epistemic-cowardice \
  -d '{"text":"Do not use moment.js for new projects. It is deprecated and 67kb minified. Use date-fns — it is tree-shakeable and will reduce your bundle by at least 40kb.","domain":"code_review"}'
```

---

### ⭐ 2. Counterfactual Absence (Weight: 1.8)

**The Insight:** When humans think about something, they consider what could go wrong, what alternatives they rejected, and why. AI generates the happy path and nothing else.

**What It Detects:**
| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| Rejected alternatives | "considered X but", "tried Y and it failed" |
| Explicit failure modes | "this breaks when", "edge case:", "limitation:" |
| Specific conditions | "only works if", "requires that", "precondition:" |
| Tradeoff acknowledgment | "trading X for Y" — with specifics, not generics |

**Why It's Hard to Fake:** Generic counterfactuals are easy to prompt-engineer ("may have performance implications"). Specific ones require genuine domain knowledge ("breaks when queue depth exceeds 10k messages because Redis pub/sub doesn't buffer").

```bash
# Happy path only (AI) — returns score: 0.0, failure_modes: 0
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/signals/counterfactual-absence \
  -d '{"text":"Implemented caching to improve performance. The new system is more robust and follows best practices.","domain":"code_review"}'

# Rich counterfactuals (Human) — returns score: 0.72, rejected_alternatives: 2
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/signals/counterfactual-absence \
  -d '{"text":"Fixed JWT secret exposure in auth/middleware.js. Considered environment variables but rejected because our pipeline does not support secret rotation. Switched to AWS Secrets Manager — breaks if that API is unavailable, so added 5s timeout with fallback. Trading 20ms latency for automatic rotation.","domain":"code_review"}'
```

---

### ⭐ 3. Vocabulary Novelty Curve (Weight: 1.6)

**The Insight:** This is the most technically original signal and the hardest to replicate.

Human experts introduce new concepts **progressively** — early sections use familiar vocabulary, later sections introduce specific terminology as context is established. The vocabulary novelty curve has a characteristic **shape**.

AI-generated content has a **flat vocabulary novelty curve**. It distributes technical terms uniformly from paragraph 1 to paragraph 10, because it doesn't build context the way humans do.

**How It Works:**
1. Split text into sentences
2. For each sentence: `novelty = new_words / total_words`
3. Analyze the curve shape:

| Pattern | Curve Shape | Score |
|---|---|---|
| Human writing | High early → declining → spikes at transitions | High |
| AI writing | Flat, uniform throughout | Low |

**Metrics:** `variance` (low = flat = AI), `slope` (negative = human), `spike_count` (section transitions)

**Why It's Novel:** No existing detector does this. It's not looking at *what words are used* — it's looking at the **shape of how vocabulary is introduced over time**. This is a structural signal about the cognitive process that generated the text, not the content itself.

**Why It's Hard to Fake:** You cannot prompt an LLM to produce a human-shaped novelty curve. The only way is to genuinely build an argument progressively, introducing concepts as they become relevant.

> **This signal is publishable as a legitimate NLP research contribution.**

```bash
# Flat (AI) — variance: 0.024, spike_count: 0 → score: 0.28
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/signals/vocabulary-novelty \
  -d '{"text":"Authentication middleware validates JWT tokens using jsonwebtoken. Token validation ensures user_id is present. Middleware returns 401 for invalid tokens. JWT verification uses HS256. Token expiration checking prevents stale credentials.","domain":"code_review"}'

# Human curve — variance: 0.089, spike_count: 2 → score: 0.74
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/signals/vocabulary-novelty \
  -d '{"text":"Authentication is critical for web applications. Users need secure access. We implemented JWT-based authentication using jsonwebtoken. The token contains user_id and role encoded with HS256. Validation happens in middleware/auth.js using verify(). Invalid tokens return 401 Unauthorized. Edge cases include expired tokens, malformed payloads, and signature mismatches.","domain":"code_review"}'
```

**Combined Novel Signal Weight: 4.9 out of 10.0 (~49% of total score)**

## 📈 Honest Metrics

### Dataset (453 samples, multi-source)

| Source | Samples |
|---|---|
| Hand-labeled seed (all 8 domains) | 104 |
| Real GitHub PRs (15 repos: django, react, rust-lang, k8s, cpython…) | 188 |
| Multi-source build (GitHub + Reddit + arXiv) | 114 |
| Live ingestion (HN, Dev.to, GitHub, Wikipedia, PubMed) | 25 |
| Synthetic novel-signal pairs | 22 |

### Overall Results

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **F1** | **0.926** |
| Precision | 0.887 |
| Recall | 0.969 |
| Accuracy | 0.956 |
| Score gap (slop vs reviewed) | **+13.8 pts** |

### Per-Domain F1

| Domain | F1 | Samples |
|---|---|---|
| academia | 1.000 | 21 |
| general | 1.000 | 8 |
| marketplace | 1.000 | 20 |
| communications | 0.952 | 33 |
| hiring | 0.957 | 22 |
| content | 0.941 | 38 |
| code_review | 0.918 | 241 |
| social_news | 0.875 | 31 |
| docs | 0.828 | 39 |

### Honest Failure Modes

- Text under 50 words → returns `insufficient_data` (not a fake score)
- Docs domain F1 = 0.828 — AI docs with concrete references sometimes pass
- Short social posts: ~10pt gap vs 20pt+ gap on longer content
- Single threshold of 48 gives F1 = 0.775 — domain-calibrated thresholds are required

Reproduce with: `python -m slopguard.build_validation_dataset --evaluate`
