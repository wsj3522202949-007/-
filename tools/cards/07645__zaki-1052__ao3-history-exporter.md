# AO3 History Exporter

A tool for exporting and analyzing your Archive of Our Own (AO3) reading history.

![AO3 History Exporter](https://img.shields.io/badge/AO3-History%20Explorer-990000)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

[Companion Web App](https://ao3-history.nazalibhai.com/) - Dynamic History View

## Overview

AO3 History Exporter helps you export your entire AO3 reading history to a JSON file, allowing you to analyze your reading habits, search through past works, and create visualizations of your FanFiction preferences.

This tool is available in two formats:
- As a browser extension (for Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- As a Tampermonkey script (for any browser with Tampermonkey support)

## Features

- **Export Full Reading History**: Captures all works in your AO3 reading history
- **Comprehensive Data**: Extracts detailed information including:
  - Work details (title, author, publication date)
  - Fandom information
  - Tags (relationships, characters, freeforms)
  - Statistics (word count, kudos, comments, etc.)
  - Your personal history (last visit date, visit count)
  - Series information
- **Pause/Resume Functionality**: Handle rate limiting by pausing the extraction and resuming later
- **Partial Results**: Download partial results if the process is interrupted
- **Web App Integration**: Exported data can be loaded into a *live* web app for analysis
  - **[ao3-history.nazalibhai.com](https://ao3-history.nazalibhai.com)**
  - **How to Use**:
    - Click the "**Open in Web App**" button when the export is finished.
      - Your JSON file will automatically be loaded into the web app explorer.

## Installation

This extension is now available as a **Firefox Add-On**: 

### **[Install Here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ao3-history-exporter/)**

The following are alternative methods for Chromium-based browsers or if you want greater control over the installation.

### Method 1: Browser Extension (Manual Installation)

1. Download or clone this repository

2. **For Chrome/Edge:**
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner or left sidebar)
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the folder containing this repository

3. **For Firefox:**
   - Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
   - Select any file in the repository folder (usually manifest.json)

### Method 2: Tampermonkey Script

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your browser
2. Click on the Tampermonkey icon in your browser and select "Create a new script"
3. Delete any default code
4. Copy and paste the entire contents of `ao3-history-exporter.js` into the editor
5. Click File > Save or press Ctrl+S

## Usage

1. Navigate to your AO3 reading history page (`https://archiveofourown.org/users/USERNAME/readings`)
2. Click the "Export Reading History" button that appears below the navigation
3. Wait while the tool processes each page of your reading history
4. If you encounter rate limiting:
   - Click "Pause" to temporarily stop the process
   - Wait for some time (recommended: at least 3-6 minutes)
   - Return to the page and click "Resume" to continue
5. When complete, click "Download JSON" to save your data

### Handling Large Collections

AO3 may rate-limit requests if you have a very large reading history. Tips:
- Use the pause feature when you notice errors
- Try running the export during off-peak hours
- Consider exporting in smaller batches every few minutes

## Technical Details

The tool works by:
1. Scraping each page of your reading history
2. Extracting structured data from the HTML
3. Compiling all entries into a single JSON file

### Project Structure

- `manifest.json` - Extension manifest file
- `content.js` - Main JavaScript for the extension
- `styles.css` - CSS styling for the UI elements
- `ao3-history-exporter.js` - Standalone Tampermonkey script version

## Future Plans

### Web App Integration

The companion web app will allow you to:
- Upload your exported JSON file
- Visualize your reading patterns
- Filter and search through your history
- See statistics about your reading habits
- View charts and graphs of your fandom preferences

The export tool includes an "Open in Web App" button, and you can access the completed web app at **[https://ao3-history.nazalibhai.com/](https://ao3-history.nazalibhai.com/)**.

## Privacy

This tool runs entirely in your browser. Your reading history data is:
- Never transmitted to any server
- Only saved locally when you download the JSON file
- Not accessible to any third party
