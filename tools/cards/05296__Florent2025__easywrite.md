# Easywrite

**The academic-writing skill that makes AI-assisted papers read *human* while staying *evidence-true* — in English and 中文.**

*让 AI 辅助的学术写作既有人味、又守得住证据：去 AI 味 + 守证据 + 降 AIGC 检出率，中英双语。*

## Why this exists

A general "humanizer" strips AI tells but has no idea that *your p-value is load-bearing*. An academic polisher
fixes structure but doesn't know why clean prose still trips GPTZero. And neither one handles 中文 AI 腔. Research
writing needs all three at once, plus a hard rule that **nothing gets less true in the name of sounding human**.

Easywrite is that skill. It routes between five strengths and adds a bilingual + integrity spine:

- 🧬 **Claim ↔ evidence discipline** — no verb stronger than its data; every claim earns its number, figure, or citation. Papers, rebuttals, and grants each get the right register (grants keep their vision; papers get the strict trim).
- 🔬 **Detector science, done right** — perplexity / burstiness / stylometry. It *cuts* instead of "polishing" (polishing raises the AI score), and it tells ESL and technical writers the truth: a high score is often the detector's bias, not their writing.
- 🈶 **Bilingual** — a full English AI-tell catalog *and* a 中文 去 AI 味 engine (场景 / 档位 / scope、protected spans、无源引用三模式).
- 🎯 **Voice & venue matching** — matches your own writing sample and the target venue (NeurIPS terse vs. Nature expository vs. NSFC 规范).
- 🔒 **Integrity firewall** — never alters a number, result, or citation; never fabricates a source; not a tool for evading AI-use disclosure.

> The whole thesis in one line: **human in voice, true in substance** — writing that is easy to read and easy to trust.

## What it does (at a glance)

```
Route (language · doc-type · goal)
  └─ Diagnose  → tag paragraphs (evidence-dense = leave alone; analytical = fix here)
  └─ Protect   → lock numbers, results, cite keys, terms, system subjects
  └─ Cut       → the strongest move; remove filler, restatement, hype
  └─ Anchor    → claim ↔ evidence (papers) / claim ↔ feasibility (grants)
  └─ De-tell   → em-dashes, vocab clusters, rule-of-three, 综述腔/翻译腔
  └─ Burstiness→ uneven sentence & paragraph rhythm
  └─ Voice     → match author sample + venue register
  └─ Score     → 2 hard gates (Fidelity, Evidence) + 5-dim rubric, then STOP
```

## Use it

Once installed, just ask in natural language — the skill auto-triggers:

- *"Humanize the introduction of my paper, keep every number."*
- *"降一下这段摘要的 AIGC 检出率，别动数据和引用。"*
- *"My rebuttal reads too AI and too grovelly — tighten it and tie each reply to a change."*
- *"Polish Aim 1 of my NSF proposal but keep the vision."*
- *"这段哪里像 AI？先别改，先标问题。"* (diagnose-only mode)

## Install

<a id="install"></a>

**Option A — Skills CLI (any agent):**
```bash
npx skills add Florent2025/easywrite
```

**Option B — Claude Code plugin marketplace:**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add Florent2025/easywrite
/plugin install easywrite
```

**Option C — Manual (Claude Code / Codex / Cursor / OpenCode):**
```bash
# Claude Code (user-global):
git clone https://github.com/Florent2025/easywrite.git ~/.claude/skills/easywrite
# Codex:  ~/.codex/skills/easywrite    Cursor: .cursor/skills/easywrite    OpenCode: ~/.config/opencode/skills/easywrite
```

**Option D — No automation:** paste [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) into the conversation. It runs standalone; full power is `SKILL.md` + `references/`.

See [`install/`](install/) for per-tool notes.

## Design principles

1. **Fidelity is a gate, not a dimension.** A stylistically perfect draft that altered a number is a failure.
2. **Cutting beats rewriting.** "Polishing" smooths prose toward AI register. Remove, don't re-smooth.
3. **Preserve what works.** Evidence-dense paragraphs and evidence-tied hedges are *human* — leave them.
4. **Clusters, not isolated hits.** One em-dash proves nothing; four tells together is a confession.
5. **Honesty about limits.** It clears a flawed *stylometric* filter for a real author; it does not beat SynthID/C2PA watermarks and is not for disclosure evasion.
