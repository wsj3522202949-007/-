# AI Fake News Detector

An advanced web application powered by a Deep Learning Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that analyzes news text and classifies whether the information is Real or Fake with an outstanding **98% accuracy**.

## 🖥️ User Interface

![AI Fake News Detector UI](https://github.com/amirsohail100/AI-Fake-News-Detector/blob/main/UI.png)

## ✨ Features

- **High Accuracy:** Achieves a 98% success rate using a robust, multi-layered deep learning model.
- **Instant Verification:** Paste any news text or paragraph for immediate real-time analysis.
- **Clean Interface:** Intuitive web UI designed for straightforward and efficient user interaction.

## 🛠️ Model Architecture

The model is built using a Keras `Sequential` pipeline, combining Text Embeddings, Dense layers, Bidirectional LSTMs, and Dropout layers for optimal feature extraction and regularization:

```python
model_ann = Sequential([
    Embedding(input_dim=Max_words, output_dim=embedding_dim, input_length=Max_len),
    Dense(128, activation="relu"),
    Bidirectional(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)),
    Dropout(0.4),
    Dense(128, activation="relu"),
    Bidirectional(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(32, activation="relu"),
    Bidirectional(LSTM(16, return_sequences=False)),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(32, activation="relu"),
    Dense(16, activation="relu"),
    Dense(8, activation="relu"),
    Dropout(0.1),
    Dense(1, activation="sigmoid")
])
```

## 📦 Required Pipeline Files

To run this application properly, ensure the following pipeline files are present in your project directory:

- `model_ann.h5` (Trained ANN Model)
- `tokenizer.pkl` (Tokenizer file)
- `columns.pkl` (Data preprocessing layout)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Place the required pipeline files (`model_ann.h5`, `tokenizer.pkl`, `columns.pkl`) in the root directory.
3. Run the application script to start the local server.

## Cloud Deployment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirsohail100/AI-Fake-News-Detector.git
```

```bash
cd AI-Fake-News-Detector
```

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

```bash
python install -r requirements.txt
```
