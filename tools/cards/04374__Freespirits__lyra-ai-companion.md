# Lyra — the AI companion you call, not type at

Press call. She picks up: an emotional voice that laughs and whispers, a 3D
body that breathes, worlds that change around her mid-sentence, and a memory
of you that deepens every conversation. 100% local, 100% yours.

Under the hood: hands-free call mode with VAD barge-in, a streaming brain with
an inline tag protocol, ElevenLabs v3 emotional speech, generated video scenes,
live body swapping, mocap animation, a continuously simmering mood system, and
typed persistent memory with reflection.

![Lyra — live demo](https://github.com/Freespirits/lyra-ai-companion/blob/main/docs/media/demo.gif)

*She picks up, lip-syncs the reply, and changes her world mid-sentence — one skill, not half an hour of tools.*

*Live word-synced captions, a breathing state halo, scenes she switches
mid-sentence, and bodies you can swap without dropping the call.*

```
Browser (Vite, three.js + three-vrm)             Node backend (Express)
  call loop: VAD endpointing + continuous STT -> /api/chat (NDJSON stream)
  <- seg / audio / ctl events (sentence-pipelined eleven_v3 with audio tags)
  ordered segment player -> visemes + word-synced captions
  ears WebSocket -> prosody cues (laugh/sigh/silence/user_speaking)
```

## Get Lyra — one command

Not technical? This downloads everything, walks you through choosing an AI brain
(Ollama / OpenClaw / Claude / ChatGPT / Gemini) plus voice and hearing, and drops
a double-click launcher. You only click through the Node/Ollama installers it
opens for you — everything else is automatic.

**Any OS, one command** (if you already have [Node 20+](https://nodejs.org)):

```bash
npx create-lyra
```

Or a self-contained script that also installs Node for you:

**macOS / Linux** — paste into Terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Freespirits/lyra-ai-companion/main/install.command | bash
```

(or on a Mac, download `install.command` and right-click → Open.)

**Windows** — paste into PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Freespirits/lyra-ai-companion/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Afterwards, open her any time by double-clicking **Lyra** in the install folder
(`~/Lyra`). Chrome or Edge is required for voice calls.

## Quick start (manual / developers)

```bash
npm install    # also downloads the avatar bodies (~75 MB) and seeds .env
npm run dev    # backend on :8686, app on http://localhost:5173
```

Then edit `.env` to pick your provider, or run `node scripts/setup-wizard.mjs`
for the same guided setup the installer uses. Requires Node 20+. Chrome or Edge
required for voice calls (Web Speech API).
Note: the backend port is 8686 because Windows reserves 8758-8857
(`netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp`).

## The call

Press the phone button. From that moment the mic is always open:

- `ears.js` VAD detects your voice and triggers **predictive listening** (she
  leans in before the words are even transcribed).
- ~900ms of quiet commits the utterance to the brain. No buttons.
- Speaking while she talks **barges in**: all server-side work for the old turn
  is aborted, her history entry is rewritten to what she actually got to say.
- While she speaks, recognition results are only accepted if the VAD confirmed
  user speech (echo gate). Headphones make it perfect; speakers work.

## The control protocol (streamed tags)

The LLM streams plain prose with inline bracket tags — no JSON:

- **Audio tags** `[laughs] [whispers] [sighs] [excited] [curious] ...` stay in
  the TTS text (eleven_v3 performs them as vocal emotion) and nudge the avatar's
  mood vector at the same time. One tag drives voice and face together.
- **Directive tags** `[affect:warm] [scene:cosmos] [gesture:wave] [remember:…] [name:…]`
  are stripped before TTS and executed instantly — she sets her sustained stance,
  changes the scene, fires body language, saves a long-term memory mid-sentence,
  or learns what to call you the first time you say it.

The server splits the stream into sentences, synthesizes each segment
concurrently (order-preserving), and streams NDJSON events; she starts speaking
after the first sentence while the rest is still generating. Long replies are
the default.

The complete tag vocabulary and agent-facing contract is documented in
[docs/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/Freespirits/lyra-ai-companion/blob/main/docs/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md).

## Mood, eyes, physics (the "alive" layer)

- **Mood vector**: emotions are a weighted blend (`{happy:.8, surprised:.2}`)
  that tags nudge and time decays — never a binary switch. Expressions render
  the mix additively, so feelings visibly linger and leak.
- **Saccadic gaze**: instant micro-jumps with fixation jitter and occasional
  glances aside; asymmetric blinking (one lid leads).
- **Spring-bone tuning + head inertia**: hair and clothes carry weight and drag
  behind sharp head motion (`SPRING_TUNE` in src/avatar.js).
- **Subconscious micro-events**: fleeting half-smiles, brow flashes, deeper
  breaths, weight shifts — always running between turns.
- **Think-gap fillers**: pre-synthesized "Mmm…" / "Hm?" sounds (cached in
  server/.cache) mask LLM+TTS latency like a real person mulling it over.

## Scenes

`/api/scenes` merges built-in procedural skies (violet-dream, sunset-beach,
night-city, cosmos) with anything you drop into `public/scenes/`:
any equirectangular `.jpg/.png/.webp` becomes a 360° scene automatically, with
optional lighting overrides in `public/scenes/scenes.json`:

```json
[{ "name": "my-room", "lighting": { "key": ["#ffd9b0", .34], "rim": ["#ff6b9d", .1], "amb": ["#c9a68a", .2] } }]
```

Scene switches crossfade and lerp the lighting, safe mid-speech. Both you (the
picker in the call bar) and Lyra (`[scene:name]`) control them.

## Characters

![Bao](https://github.com/Freespirits/lyra-ai-companion/blob/main/docs/media/body-bao-cosmos.png)

The six bodies are six distinct **characters** — each a different companion with
their own personality, voice, and default scene: Lyra the steady one, Nova the
spark, Mira the muse, Vesper the composed, Kira the storm, and Bao — an ancient,
absurd, permanently hungry panda who does kung fu. Pick one from the character
button; body, voice, scene, and persona all switch together, and they greet you
in character. Never met before? They introduce themselves and ask your name. On the OpenClaw
path (where your agent owns the brain), each character's persona is injected per
turn so they stay distinct. Every `.vrm` in `public/models/` is auto-discovered —
build your own in VRoid Studio (free) and export VRM.

Body credits: the five humans are the official VRoid sample models; Bao is
"Teddy" by Polygonal Mind (CC0, via Open Source Avatars), repainted into a
panda and given a synthesized expression set by `scripts/fetch-assets.mjs`.

## Mocap clips

Download clips from Mixamo (free, Adobe account; export FBX Binary, Without
Skin, 30fps) into `public/animations/`. File names are matched
case-insensitively:

| File | Mixamo search | Used for |
|---|---|related:
  - methods/人物思维蒸馏法.md
  - methods/模板库.md
---|
| `idle.fbx` `idle2.fbx` `idle3.fbx` | Breathing/Standing Idle | idle rotation |
| `happy-idle.fbx` / `sad-idle.fbx` | Happy Idle / Sad Idle | mood idles |
| `listen.fbx` / `think.fbx` | Standing Idle / Thinking | listening / thinking |
| `talk.fbx` `talk2.fbx` | Talking | speaking |
| `wave.fbx` `excited.fbx` `agree.fbx` `shrug.fbx` | (same) | gestures |

Missing files are skipped; without any clips a procedural idle takes over.

## Providers (.env)

**LLM** (`LLM_PROVIDER`): `ollama` (local; `OLLAMA_MODEL`), `anthropic`
(`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), the **subscription CLIs — no API key**: `claude-code`
(spawns `claude -p`, your Claude subscription), `codex` (ChatGPT subscription),
`gemini-cli` (Google account), or **`openclaw`** (see below). All stream.

**OpenClaw bridge** (`LLM_PROVIDER=openclaw`): make Lyra the talking, lip-synced
face of your own [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agent. She
connects to the Gateway as an operator over its local WebSocket, streams your
agent's replies into her voice and body, and sends your speech back — **zero
model config**, because the brain, memory, and tools stay inside your OpenClaw.
Set `OPENCLAW_TOKEN` (from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` → `gateway.auth.token`).
Teach your agent to *perform* (gestures, expressions, scenes) with the companion
skill on ClawHub: `openclaw skills install @Freespirits/clawlyra`
([clawhub.ai/Freespirits/clawlyra](https://clawhub.ai/Freespirits/clawlyra), source in `skills/clawlyra/`).

**Content guard** (`LYRA_GUARD`, **off by default — opt-in**): the characters'
no-romance boundary is baked into their personas and is **always on**, so it holds
with this guard off — enabling the guard only *adds* a moderation pass. Set
`LYRA_GUARD=on` for a fast keyword filter that blocks explicit sexual, aggressive,
and harmful replies and redirects in character. For an optional stronger layer that
*understands* content instead of matching keywords, also set `GUARD_MODEL` to a Llama
Guard model — but the small `llama-guard3:1b` tends to over-flag warm, platonic talk,
so prefer `llama-guard3:8b`. Empty `GUARD_MODEL` = keyword-only.

**STT**: set `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` for Deepgram nova live streaming (server-side
relay on `/stt`, best accuracy + endpointing); without it, the free Web Speech
API is used. Whisper on-device is the mobile plan (docs/MOBILE_PLAN.md).

**Attachments**: the + button in the chat drawer takes images, video (a frame
is extracted), .txt/.md, and PDF. Anthropic reads images+PDFs natively; Ollama
gets images (vision models); text files inline everywhere.

**TTS** (`TTS_PROVIDER`):
- `elevenlabs` (recommended): `ELEVENLABS_MODEL=eleven_v3` performs the audio
  tags with real emotion, and `/with-timestamps` drives exact viseme lip sync.
- `edge`: free Microsoft neural voices (tags stripped, energy-based lip sync).
- `browser`: OS speechSynthesis fallback.

Note: the server loads `.env` with `override:true`, so a stale
`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in your Windows environment variables can't shadow it.

**Aura** (`AURA_PROVIDER`): `hue` / `ha` / `off` — room lighting follows her
state and mood (server/aura.js).

## Sensory feedback loop (ambient ears)

The mic stream is analyzed continuously (RMS + pitch, client-side) and compact
prosody frames feed the backend cue engine (`server/ears.js`): laughs make her
smile before you type a word, sighs get a concerned tilt, long silences a weight
shift; cues are also folded into the next LLM call as
`[heard through the mic: ...]` context.

## Where to take it next

1. **Local STT**: swap Web Speech for faster-whisper + VAD endpointing for
   sub-second, fully offline turn-taking.
2. **Real 360° photography** in public/scenes/ (the shipped skies are procedural).

(A voice per body already shipped: each character carries its own voice IDs in
`server/archetypes.js`, resolved per provider by `pickVoice`.)
