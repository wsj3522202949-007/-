# 📜 lore

> *The spellbook for your codebase — chronicle decisions, context, and lessons your AI companions can actually read.*

**Lore** is a local AI memory system for software projects. It stores what you know as plain YAML alongside your code — then publishes that knowledge as instruction files that GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Codex, and other AI tools read automatically.

No external database. No API keys. No cloud sync. Everything lives in `.lore/` next to your code.

By default, lore exports **CHRONICLE.md plus all agent adapter files** so security and instruction preambles are consistently written for every tool.

---

## How it works

AI coding tools are stateless — they don't remember why you chose PostgreSQL over SQLite, that the auth layer must never bypass JWT validation, or that the frontend team deprecated the v1 API six months ago. You end up re-explaining the same context in every session.

Lore fixes that. You capture knowledge once; every AI session inherits it automatically.

```
Your decisions, facts, and lessons
        ↓  lore add / lore relic
  .lore/ (plain YAML)
        ↓  lore export
  CHRONICLE.md  ←  full project memory (one source of truth)
        ↓ referenced by lean instruction files:
  copilot-instructions.md · AGENTS.md · CLAUDE.md · .cursor/rules/memory.md
        ↓ on-demand:
  /lore  →  reads CHRONICLE.md into AI context when you ask
        ↓
  Every AI tool reads your repo context — without you repeating yourself
```

---

## Core concepts

### Spell *(memory)*

A single piece of knowledge: a decision, a fact, a hard-won lesson. Short, specific, retrievable by semantic search.

```sh
lore add decisions "Use PostgreSQL — we need JSONB and row-level locking"
lore add facts     "Auth service is the sole issuer of JWTs — never bypass it"
lore add preferences "Prefer explicit over clever — this codebase has many contributors"
```

### Tome *(category)*

A named collection of spells. Default tomes: **decisions, facts, preferences, summaries**. You can add your own in `.lore/config.yaml`.

Tomes are just directory names — each spell is one YAML file filed under its tome.

### Relic

A raw artifact saved as-is for later processing. Use a relic when things are moving fast and you don't have time to curate.

> Capture a relic now → distill spells from it later.

A relic can be anything: a pasted session log, a git diff, a doc excerpt from Confluence, a long Slack thread. It lands in `.lore/relics/` untouched. When you have time, you open it with `lore relic distill` and choose exactly which parts become proper spells.

### Export *(the chronicle)*

`lore export` writes your spells into the files AI tools pick up automatically, using a **two-layer architecture**:

**`CHRONICLE.md`** — the single source of truth. Contains every spell grouped by tome. All lean instruction files reference it.

| Lean instruction file | Tool | On by default |
|---|---|:---:|
| `CHRONICLE.md` | All tools (full memory) | ✅ |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot | ✅ |
| `AGENTS.md` | OpenAI Codex, agent frameworks | ✅ |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Anthropic Claude | ✅ |
| `.cursor/rules/memory.md` | Cursor | ✅ |
| `.github/prompts/lore.prompt.md` | `/lore` trigger in Copilot Chat | ✅ |
| `.windsurfrules` | Windsurf / Codeium | ✅ |
| `GEMINI.md` | Gemini CLI | ✅ |
| `.clinerules` | Cline | ✅ |
| `CONVENTIONS.md` | Aider | ✅ |

Lean instruction files are intentionally small — they contain your project description, security preamble, and a single line telling the AI to read `CHRONICLE.md` for full context. This keeps per-request token overhead minimal.

To disable targets after onboarding, set them in `.lore/config.yaml`:

```yaml
export_targets:
  windsurf: false
  gemini: false
  cline: false
  aider: false
```

Exports are atomic — a crash mid-write never leaves a partial file.

---

## Install

```sh
pip install lore-book
```

### Windows (recommended)

If you publish the Scoop bucket, this becomes the cleanest install path for Windows users:

```powershell
scoop bucket add cptplastic https://github.com/CptPlastic/scoop-lore-book
scoop install lore-book
```

Until that bucket is live, use `pipx`:

Use the Python launcher so the command works consistently across Windows setups:

```powershell
py -m pip install --upgrade lore-book
```

If you prefer isolated CLI installs, `pipx` is the smoothest option on Windows:

```powershell
py -m pip install --user pipx
py -m pipx ensurepath
pipx install lore-book
```

If you are installing from this repository, use the bootstrap script:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install_windows.ps1
```

Optional modes:

```powershell
# Force plain pip install mode
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install_windows.ps1 -Mode pip

# Install from local source path via pipx
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install_windows.ps1 -SourcePath .
```

### Windows package managers

Scoop is the intended easiest Windows package-manager path once your bucket is published.

Until then, `pipx install lore-book` is the easiest path for most users.

This repo now generates Windows packaging artifacts during release:

- Scoop manifest: `packaging/scoop/lore-book.json`
- winget submission helper: `packaging/winget/submission-<version>.md`

After each release, use these to publish:

1. Submit `packaging/scoop/lore-book.json` to your Scoop bucket repository.
2. Use `packaging/winget/submission-<version>.md` to open/update a PR in `microsoft/winget-pkgs`.

A ready-to-push Scoop bucket template is included in `packaging/scoop-bucket-template/`.

### Automatic Scoop bucket PRs

This repository includes a workflow that can open a PR against `CptPlastic/scoop-lore-book` whenever `packaging/scoop/lore-book.json` changes:

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/sync-scoop-bucket.yml`
- Required secret: `SCOOP_BUCKET_PAT`

`SCOOP_BUCKET_PAT` should have write access to `CptPlastic/scoop-lore-book` (classic `repo` scope, or fine-grained token with `contents` + `pull_requests` write).

For local development:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+. Lore works out of the box with TF-IDF search. Dense vector search (sentence-transformers) is optional and can be enabled with the setup wizard below.

### Enable dense vector search (wizard)

Want dense vector search? Run:

```sh
lore setup semantic
```

The wizard will:

- check whether `sentence-transformers` is installed
- offer to install semantic dependencies if missing
- validate model loading with your configured `embedding_model`, `model_endpoint`, and SSL settings

If you prefer non-interactive setup:

```sh
lore setup semantic --install-now
```

Default endpoint for Hugging Face models is:

```text
https://huggingface.co
```

If dense model loading fails, lore automatically falls back to TF-IDF so search still works.

---

## Documentation site (GitHub Pages)

This repository now includes a plain static docs site in `docs/` for GitHub Pages.

Preview locally:

```sh
cd docs
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

Publishing is handled by `.github/workflows/docs.yml` on pushes to `main`/`master`.

To migrate existing docs pages into this repo, add or edit static files under `docs/`.

---

## Quick start

```sh
lore onboard
```

The onboarding command explains every concept, walks you through store setup, security policy, your first spell, and publishing — with an interactive step-by-step flow. It also prompts for a **project description** (auto-detected from `pyproject.toml` or README) that appears at the top of every lean instruction file. Start here if you're new.

Onboard/Init also add local adapter files to `.gitignore` by default, so only shared chronicle memory is committed unless you choose otherwise.

---

## Spells — adding and searching memories

```sh
# Interactive, step-by-step
lore add

# Save and auto-link related spells
lore add decisions "Use FastAPI — async support + automatic OpenAPI docs" --tags api,backend --auto-associate

# One-liner (scriptable, CI-friendly)
lore add decisions "Use FastAPI — async support + automatic OpenAPI docs"
lore add preferences "Always use type hints" --tags style,python
lore add facts "Minimum supported Python is 3.10"

# Suggest or apply related links for an existing spell
lore associate <id>
lore associate <id> --apply

# Semantic search — finds conceptually related spells, not just keyword matches
lore search "why did we choose FastAPI"
lore search "authentication strategy"

# List all spells
lore list

# List by tome
lore list decisions

# Delete a spell
lore remove <id>
```

Spell IDs are short UUID prefixes. `lore list` shows them.

---

## New in v1.4.1 - auto association

Lore can now suggest relationship links between spells automatically.

```sh
# During add
lore add facts "Scoop installer uses local extracted payload" --tags windows,scoop --auto-associate

# Tune association behavior
lore add decisions "..." --auto-associate --associate-top 5 --associate-min-score 0.30

# Existing spells
lore associate a1b2c3d4
lore associate a1b2c3d4 --apply
```

How scoring works:
- semantic similarity score (dense embeddings or TF-IDF fallback)
- shared tag bonus
- same-category bonus

Applied links are symmetric in `related_to` so both spells reference each other.

---

## New in v1.4.0 - context keeper features

The 1.4.0 release adds relationship metadata, linting, trust history, and configurable extraction patterns.

### 1) Add metadata to spells

You can link memories together, mark deprecations, and set review dates.

```sh
# Interactive (includes metadata steps)
lore add

# Scriptable form
lore add decisions "Use OAuth device flow for CLI auth" \
  --depends-on 02e0914c,6c8887fe \
  --related-to e07d12be \
  --review-date 2026-06-01

# Mark a memory as deprecated later
lore edit e07d12be
```

Metadata fields:
- `depends_on` - memory IDs this entry relies on
- `related_to` - memory IDs that are contextually related
- `deprecated` - lifecycle flag for old guidance
- `review_date` - date to revisit stale decisions

### 2) Run memory quality checks with lore lint

```sh
# Show findings only
lore lint

# Fail CI on errors
lore lint --fail-on error

# Fail CI on errors and warnings
lore lint --fail-on error,warning
```

`lore lint` checks:
- empty memory content
- likely duplicates
- invalid instruction scope tags
- broken relationship references
- invalid or past review dates
- invalid deprecated flag types
- trust score threshold warnings

### 3) Track trust changes over time

```sh
# Recompute trust from git signals
lore trust refresh

# Explain one memory's trust and see recent history
lore trust explain e07d12be
```

Each refresh writes rolling trust snapshots (score, level, reasons, timestamp) so score changes are auditable.

### 4) Teach extraction your commit conventions

Use the new interactive pattern manager:

```sh
lore setup extract-patterns
```

This lets you add regex or prefix rules that auto-categorize commit-derived memories during extraction.

Then extract as usual:

```sh
lore extract --last 20 --auto
```

Example conventions:
- `chore(release):` -> `decisions`
- `docs:` -> `summaries`
- `fix:` -> `facts`

---

##  Relics — capture now, curate later

Use relics when you want to preserve raw information without slowing down to decide what matters.

```sh
# Paste session notes interactively (enter . to finish)
lore relic capture

# Pull in a file — meeting notes, spec doc, wiki export
lore relic capture --file session-notes.md --title "Auth redesign session"

# Snapshot the current working-tree + staged diff
lore relic capture --git-diff --title "Pre-deploy changes"

# Capture the last N commits (messages + diffs)
lore relic capture --git-log 5 --title "Sprint 12 wrap-up"

# Read from clipboard (Windows: PowerShell Get-Clipboard, macOS: pbpaste, Linux: xclip)
lore relic capture --clipboard --title "Slack thread on rate limiting"

# Pipe anything in
git log --oneline -20 | lore relic capture --stdin --title "Recent commit history"
cat confluence-export.txt | lore relic capture --stdin --title "Architecture decision"

# Browse relics (shows preview of content)
lore relic list

# Read one in full
lore relic view a3f1b2c4

# Distill the good parts into spells
lore relic distill a3f1b2c4

# Delete a relic
lore relic remove a3f1b2c4
```

### Distilling

`lore relic distill` shows you the relic content and walks you through extracting spells one at a time:

```
  ─── Spell #1 ────────────────────────────────────────────
  ✦ Inscription  the wisdom to enshrine  (. to seal the book): We chose CQRS to
    separate read and write models after hitting contention on the orders table
  ✦ Tome         which grimoire? [decisions]:
  ✓  Spell a1b2c3d4 sealed into decisions.

  ─── Spell #2 ────────────────────────────────────────────
  ...
```

Each spell links back to its source relic. The tome selection is sticky — after you choose `decisions` for spell #1, it defaults to `decisions` for spell #2. Enter `.` to finish.

---

## Exporting AI context files

```sh
# Write all enabled context files (default: CHRONICLE + all adapters)
lore export

# Write one target only
lore export --format chronicle
lore export --format copilot
lore export --format agents
lore export --format claude
lore export --format cursor
lore export --format prompt    # .github/prompts/lore.prompt.md
lore export --format windsurf  # requires: windsurf: true in .lore/config.yaml
lore export --format gemini
lore export --format cline
lore export --format aider
```

If no `project_description` is set, `lore export` will remind you to run `lore onboard` — lean instruction files are more useful with a one-line project summary at the top.

Exports are regenerated every run. Adapter files are gitignored by default, so teams can commit only `CHRONICLE.md` unless they opt into versioning adapter files.

### The `/lore` trigger

The `prompt` export target writes `.github/prompts/lore.prompt.md`. In GitHub Copilot Chat, type `/lore` to invoke it — the AI will read `CHRONICLE.md` and surface context relevant to your current task. No setup beyond running `lore export`.

## Trust model (how to use it as a user)

Treat lore memory as layered trust, even before advanced trust metadata exists:

1. **Shared trusted memory (commit this)**
- `CHRONICLE.md` is your canonical reviewed memory.
- Only include decisions/facts you want every collaborator and agent to inherit.

2. **Local working memory (do not commit)**
- Keep generated adapter files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, etc.) local by default.
- Use them as personal tool wrappers around the same shared chronicle.

3. **Raw untrusted intake**
- Capture noisy inputs as relics first (`lore relic capture`).
- Distill only verified points into spells (`lore relic distill`).

4. **Practical review loop**
- Add candidate memory.
- Validate against code/tests/docs.
- Export chronicle.
- Commit `CHRONICLE.md` only when reviewed.

5. **Trust signals you can use today**
- Reserve `decisions` and `facts` for high-confidence entries.
- Use tags to mark confidence state (for example: `verified`, `needs-review`, `deprecated`).
- Move or remove stale entries quickly with `lore remove` + re-add in correct form.

### Automate trust scoring from git

You can auto-score existing memories from git metadata (author, source, activity, tags):

```sh
lore trust refresh
```

Preview only (no writes):

```sh
lore trust refresh --dry-run
```

Explain one memory's score:

```sh
lore trust explain <id>
lore trust explain <id> --recompute
```

Tune trust thresholds in `.lore/config.yaml`:

```yaml
trust:
  default_score: 50
  chronicle_min_score: 60
  trusted_authors:
    - "Your Name"
  author_weights:
    "Release Bot": 10
```

When `chronicle_min_score` is greater than `0`, `lore export` includes only entries at or above that score in `CHRONICLE.md`.

---

## Git integration

### Post-commit hook

`lore hook install` opens an interactive wizard that installs a `.git/hooks/post-commit` script:

```sh
lore hook install
```

The wizard asks whether you want:
- **Auto-extract** — scan each new commit message for decisions and facts, store them automatically
- **Auto-export** — regenerate all AI context files after every commit so they're always current

The generated hook is clearly marked `# Installed by lore`. Remove it safely with:

```sh
lore hook uninstall
```

Lore-managed hooks include a re-entry guard and shared lock (`.git/.lore-hook.lock`) so running both
post-commit and post-merge hooks does not recurse.

### Post-merge CHRONICLE sync hook

Install a post-merge hook that syncs shared `CHRONICLE.md` updates into local `.lore/` whenever pull/merge changes the chronicle:

```sh
lore hook sync-install
```

Remove it safely with:

```sh
lore hook sync-uninstall
```

### Extracting from past commits

```sh
# Extract from the last 20 commits
lore extract --last 20
```

Lore scans commit messages for structured knowledge and adds it to your store.

### Syncing shared CHRONICLE updates

If a teammate updates `CHRONICLE.md` and you pull those changes, import them back into your local `.lore/` store with:

```sh
lore sync
```

Useful flags:

```sh
# Preview only
lore sync --dry-run

# Import from a different markdown file
lore sync --file ./path/to/CHRONICLE.md

# Import only (skip export pass)
lore sync --no-export
```

`lore sync` deduplicates by category/content (and scope tags for instructions), so re-running it is safe.

If you run the watcher daemon, CHRONICLE sync can happen automatically:

```sh
lore awaken
```

By default, `lore awaken` watches `.lore/` changes for export and also watches `CHRONICLE.md` to import/sync changes back into `.lore`.

Config toggles:

```sh
# Disable CHRONICLE auto-sync while daemon is running
lore config auto_sync_chronicle false

# Re-enable it
lore config auto_sync_chronicle true
```

You can also override per run:

```sh
lore awaken --no-sync-chronicle
```

Automatic memory linking can be configured globally in `.lore/config.yaml`:

```yaml
association:
  enabled: true
  auto_apply_min_score: 0.55
  suggest_min_score: 0.35
  max_links_per_memory: 3
  stages:
    add: true
    edit: true
    sync: true
    extract: true
    watch: false
```

Watch-mode linking is available but off by default:

```sh
lore awaken --associate
```

## Harmonize

`harmonize` is the contradiction-checking and rollup feature.

It does two things in one pass:
- clusters closely related spells into candidate summary rollups
- flags likely contradictions across spells in the same tome

By default it is report-only and writes nothing.

If you want a guided setup flow instead of editing YAML directly:

```sh
lore setup harmonize
```

The setup wizard walks through each option interactively. During the AI summary step it checks your environment for `LORE_AI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` and shows a clear status — green if a key is found, yellow with setup instructions if not. The extra AI fields (model, URL, timeout) only appear when you opt in.

### Basic usage

```sh
# Preview rollups + contradictions
lore harmonize

# Broaden candidate recall
lore harmonize --min-score 0.50 --contradiction-min-confidence 0.60

# Persist rollup summaries
lore harmonize --apply

# Persist rollups and contradiction-resolution suggestions
lore harmonize --apply --apply-resolutions
```

The current implementation is intentionally conservative:
- source spells are never overwritten
- harmonize maintains one rolling `harmonize:snapshot` summary entry by default
- created summaries are linked back to their source spells unless disabled

When a snapshot already exists, harmonize updates it in place so Chronicle stays compact.
Legacy harmonize rollup/resolution entries are pruned during apply.

### Watch mode

Harmonize can also run from the daemon:

```sh
# Watch .lore and auto-create harmonized rollups
lore awaken --harmonize

# Also persist contradiction-resolution suggestions while watching
lore awaken --harmonize --harmonize-apply-resolutions
```

This is disabled by default because background harmonization can create noisy summaries in fast-moving stores.

### Tuning config

Add a `harmonize` block to `.lore/config.yaml`:

```yaml
harmonize:
  enabled: true
  watch: false
  top_k: 3
  min_score: 0.62
  max_rollups: 10
  contradiction_min_confidence: 0.67
  suggest_resolutions: true
  apply_resolutions: false
  ai_summary:
    enabled: false
    model: gpt-4o-mini
    base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
    timeout_seconds: 12
    max_output_tokens: 260
    max_chars: 1400
```

Field meanings:
- `enabled` - global on/off switch for harmonize features
- `watch` - allow `lore awaken` to run harmonize automatically without passing `--harmonize`
- `top_k` - how many related spells are considered per harmonize anchor
- `min_score` - minimum association score required before a rollup candidate is proposed
- `max_rollups` - cap on generated rollup candidates per run
- `contradiction_min_confidence` - minimum confidence required before a contradiction is shown
- `suggest_resolutions` - include resolution suggestions in report mode
- `apply_resolutions` - when harmonize writes during watch mode, also persist resolution suggestions
- `ai_summary.enabled` - when true, harmonize asks an AI model to write the snapshot text
- `ai_summary.model` - chat-completions model name used for AI snapshot generation
- `ai_summary.base_url` - OpenAI-compatible API base URL
- `ai_summary.timeout_seconds` - request timeout for AI snapshot generation
- `ai_summary.max_output_tokens` - response token budget for generated snapshot text
- `ai_summary.max_chars` - hard cap for stored snapshot size

For API credentials, set one of these environment variables before running harmonize:

```sh
export LORE_AI_API_KEY=sk-...      # preferred
# or
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

`lore setup harmonize` will tell you if a key is detected in your environment. Without a key, AI summary silently falls back to the local deterministic snapshot — no errors, no noise.

### Recommended presets

For small, curated stores:

```yaml
harmonize:
  top_k: 2
  min_score: 0.70
  max_rollups: 6
  contradiction_min_confidence: 0.75
  suggest_resolutions: true
  apply_resolutions: false
```

Use this when the store is mostly high-signal and you want only the strongest findings.

For medium team stores:

```yaml
harmonize:
  top_k: 3
  min_score: 0.62
  max_rollups: 10
  contradiction_min_confidence: 0.67
  suggest_resolutions: true
  apply_resolutions: false
```

This is the default balance for most repos.

For noisy or rapidly changing stores:

```yaml
harmonize:
  top_k: 4
  min_score: 0.50
  max_rollups: 15
  contradiction_min_confidence: 0.58
  suggest_resolutions: true
  apply_resolutions: false
```

Use this when you want broader recall and are willing to review more false positives.

### Practical guidance

- Raise `min_score` if rollups are grouping unrelated spells.
- Lower `min_score` if harmonize is missing obvious sibling spells.
- Raise `contradiction_min_confidence` if contradiction reports feel noisy.
- Lower `contradiction_min_confidence` if you want earlier warning on drifting facts.
- Keep `apply_resolutions` off until your store has stable review habits.

## Updates

```sh
# Check for updates
lore update --check-only

# Prompted install
lore update

# Non-interactive install
lore update --yes
```

Optional startup auto-update toggle:

```sh
lore config auto_update true
```

With `auto_update` enabled, running plain `lore` will check PyPI and auto-install newer versions when available.

---

## Security guidelines

`lore security` configures a security preamble injected at the top of every export. This ensures every AI tool that reads your repo context also receives your security constraints before anything else.

```sh
lore security
```

The preamble can include:

- **OWASP Top 10** reference (prevents the classics: injection, broken auth, SSRF, etc.)
- **Security policy file** link (e.g. `SECURITY.md`)
- **CODEOWNERS** notice — warns that sensitive paths need human review
- **Custom rules** — any project-specific edicts ("Never disable SSL verification", "All secrets via env vars", etc.)

This is especially useful in GitHub Enterprise environments where Copilot should always be reminded of your security posture before providing suggestions.

---

## Store layout

```
.lore/
  config.yaml            ← store settings, categories, model config, security
  decisions/             ← why things were built a certain way
  facts/                 ← project context, constraints, team conventions
  preferences/           ← coding style, tooling choices
  summaries/             ← AI session summaries, sprint recaps
  relics/                ← raw captured artifacts (sessions, diffs, docs)
  embeddings/
    index.json           ← local semantic search index (no external DB)
```

Each spell and relic is a plain YAML file. No database engine, no lock files, no proprietary format. You can read, edit, and commit them directly.

`.lore/` is automatically added to `.gitignore` on `lore init`. Local adapter exports are also gitignored by default so teams can commit only `CHRONICLE.md` as shared memory.

---

## TUI

```sh
lore ui
```

A retro phosphor-green terminal browser for searching, reading, adding, and exporting memories. Live-reloads whenever `.lore/` files change on disk — open it in a split pane while you work.

TUI keys:
- `a` add
- `u` edit
- `d` delete
- `x` suggest/apply associations for selected spell
- `h` run harmonize preview/apply (rollups + contradiction checks)
- `g` dependency map
- `e` export

---

## Background daemon

```sh
# Start watching — auto-exports on every .lore change
lore awaken

# Run in background
lore awaken --background

# Optional: auto-harmonize while watching
lore awaken --harmonize

# Stop the daemon
lore slumber
```

The daemon watches `.lore/` with filesystem events and regenerates all export files the moment any spell or config changes. Zero-friction — add a spell, your AI tools get it immediately.

---

## Health check

```sh
lore doctor

# Pretty machine-readable report
lore doctor --json

# Compact one-line JSON for CI logs/parsers
lore doctor --json-compact

# Fail unless status is healthy
lore doctor --json --strict

# Bound semantic probe runtime (seconds)
lore doctor --json --model-timeout 8

# Apply safe automatic repairs before reporting
lore doctor --fix

# Preview repairs without applying them
lore doctor --fix-dry-run --json
```

Reports:
- Whether the `.lore/` store exists and is readable
- Which semantic search mode is active (embedding model or TF-IDF fallback)
- Whether the configured model endpoint is reachable
- Counts of spells by tome and relics

JSON output includes a top-level `status` field for easy automation:
- `healthy` - store exists and semantic search is active
- `degraded` - store exists but semantic model is unavailable (TF-IDF fallback)
- `error` - store missing or doctor could not run required checks

Doctor JSON also includes `recommended_action` so scripts and users can surface the next best command automatically.

`lore doctor --fix` applies only safe automatic remediations:
- initialize a missing `.lore/` store in the current directory
- repair missing or invalid identity metadata
- rebuild the semantic index
- export current AI context files
- install the lore post-commit hook when inside a git repo and no hook exists yet

Use `lore doctor --fix-dry-run` to preview these actions without modifying the repo.

Automation-friendly JSON is also available on core operational commands:

```sh
lore list --json
lore search "auth strategy" --json-compact
lore lint --json
```

CI gating examples:

```sh
# Fail only on hard errors
lore doctor --json-compact | jq -e '.status != "error"' >/dev/null

# Fail on anything except healthy
lore doctor --json --strict
```

PowerShell (Windows CI):

```powershell
$report = lore doctor --json-compact | ConvertFrom-Json
if ($report.status -eq "error") { throw "lore doctor failed" }
```

## Release smoke test

Run a clean, isolated CLI smoke test before publishing:

```sh
./smoke.sh
```

What it does:

- creates a temporary workspace + virtualenv
- installs the current project as a normal package (`pip install .`)
- runs `lore version`, `lore init`, `lore add`, `lore trust refresh --dry-run`, and `lore export --format chronicle`
- exits non-zero on failure

Optional environment variables:

```sh
PYTHON_BIN=python3.12 ./smoke.sh
KEEP_SMOKE=1 ./smoke.sh
```

## Automated releases

Use the GitHub Actions workflow `Prepare Release` to automate versioning and changelog updates.

What it does:

- bumps `src/lore/__init__.py` version (`patch`, `minor`, `major`, or explicit version)
- generates/updates `CHANGELOG.md` from commit subjects since the last tag
- commits and pushes the version + changelog update
- creates and pushes a git tag
- creates a GitHub Release with generated release notes
- triggers the existing PyPI publish workflow when the release is published

How to run it:

1. Open GitHub Actions for this repo.
2. Run `Prepare Release`.
3. Choose `bump` (`patch`/`minor`/`major`) or provide an explicit `version`.

After it completes, you should see a new tag, updated `CHANGELOG.md`, and a published release.

## Corporate proxy / Artifactory

By default Lore downloads models from `https://huggingface.co`. If you're behind a ZScaler proxy or using an internal HuggingFace mirror:

```sh
lore config model_endpoint https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/huggingfaceml/huggingface
lore config model_ssl_verify false   # only if SSL inspection breaks certificate validation
```

Run `lore doctor` to confirm the model downloads and loads from your endpoint.
